The club's 2011 Minor League Player of the Year, he joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as a free agent following the '19 season. \n Calhoun was All-State twice in baseball and once in football in high school.  He hit .302 as a college freshman, then, in the Northwoods League, he had a league-low 0.38 ERA and 14 saves while also batting .286 with 6 homers, sharing MVP honors with Dan Robertson.  In 2008, Kole improved to .413 with 18 home runs and 4 saves on the bump for Yavapai College, winning All-Conference honors.  In 2009, he transferred to Arizona State and posted a .313/.437/.583 line with 42 walks (fourth in the Pac-10), 12 home runs and 53 RBI in 63 games.  In 7 innings pitched, he allowed 11 runs (9 earned).  He was 9 for 16 with 3 homers and 11 RBI in the 2009 College World Series, making the All-Series team alongside Jared Mitchell and Ryan Schimpf in the outfield.  He hit both a 3-run homer and a grand slam in ASU's wins over UNC.  In 2010, Calhoun hit .321/.478/.616 with 17 home runs, 64 walks and 59 RBI in 61 games.  He led the Pac-10 in walks by a whopping 23, was third in OBP, 5th in slugging, 3rd in runs, 5th in total bases (138), 4th in RBI, second in home runs (3 behind Ricky Oropesa), making All-Conference in the outfield.  He tied for third in NCAA Division I in walks behind only Michael Choice and Anthony Rendon.  The Angels and scout John Gracio took him in the 8th round of the 2010 amateur draft, one pick before Kyle Roller, a 2009 All-American.\n In his pro debut with the 2010 Orem Owlz, Kole hit .292/.411/.505 with 39 walks, 43 runs scored and 42 RBI in 56 games, gunning down 9 runners from the outfield.  He tied Randall Thorpe for 4th in the Pioneer League in walks.  He was even better in '11, posting a .324/.410/.547 line with 94 runs scored, 99 RBI, 36 doubles, 6 triples, 22 home runs, 73 walks and 20 steals (in 30 tries) for the Inland Empire 66ers.  He was among the California League leaders in total bases (280, 3rd behind Angelo Songco and Gary Brown), average (6th), hits (166, 4th between Songco and Josh Rutledge), doubles (tied for 6th), triples (tied for 10th), homers (tied for 6th with Nathan Freiman, Kody Hinze and Tommy Joseph), RBI (5th), runs scored (7th), walks (6th between Jarrett Parker and Hinze), OBP (4th between Rutledge and Brown), slugging (4th between Songco and Choice) and OPS (3rd behind Jedd Gyorko and Kent Matthes).  He was named to the league All-Star team as a utility man, the outfielders picked were Choice, Brown and Matthes, and was named the Angels' Minor League Player of the Year, leading Halo minor leaguers in home runs, slugging, hits, total bases and walks (tied) and finishing second in RBI (one behind Jeff Baisley).  Baseball America did not name him among the California League's top 20 prospects.  Calhoun began 2012 with the Salt Lake Bees and was at .296/.365/.491 with 14 doubles, 30 runs and 31 RBI in 43 games.  He was then called up to the majors with Vernon Wells and Ryan Langerhans going on the DL.\n In his debut, Calhoun entered as a 9th-inning defensive sub in right field for Mark Trumbo on May 22, 2012 and played a quiet inning in a 5-0 win over the Oakland A's.  The theme of 2012 seemed to be \"quiet\" at the big level, as he hit just .174 in 21 games with a skinny extra base hit (a double).  In 2013, he played 58 games, hitting .282 with 8 homers and 32 RBI for an OPS+ of 128.  That put him in line for a starting job in 2014 as he took over as the starting right fielder.  He played 127 games, during which he hit .272 with 31 doubles, 17 homers and 58 RBI, while scoring 90 runs.  All of those runs scored resulted from the fact that he was largely used as the lead-off hitter, as the Angels lacked a player with a more typical skillset for the role.  Once again, his OPS+ was excellent at 121, while the Angels put up the best record in the American League.  Unlike most of his teammates, he was not muzzled in the ALDS, going 5 for 15 in three games against the Kansas City Royals; the Angels were still swept in three games.\n On April 23, 2015 he had the Angels' only hit in a 2-0 win over the Oakland Athletics, a home run off Jesse Chavez in the 3rd inning after Drew Butera reached on an error.  Calhoun won a Gold Glove as the American League's best defensive right fielder that season and reached the 20 homer mark for the first time, hitting .256 with 26 homers and 83 RBI.  That was the first of a string of five straight season in which he started almost every day in right field for the Angels (he played over 150 games in four of the five seasons) and hit well, if not spectacularly.  The exception was 2018, when he batted just .208 after an awful first half which saw him hit just .187. He was just below 20 homers every year from 2016 to 2018, then, in 2019, reached a personal best with 33 long balls.  He generally hit towards the top of the order, thanks to his ability to draw walks, and scored over 90 runs in both 2016 and 2019 .  The Angels failed to return to the postseason after their quick exit in 2014, even with the best player in the universe, Mike Trout, hitting in the middle of the lineup.\n Following the 2019 season, Calhoun became a free agent and, on December 30th, signed a two-year deal with his hometown team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, worth $16 million. The Diamondbacks had played the previous year with a patched together outfield and needed a reliable, if unspectacular, player like Calhoun to consolidate the position. On August 5, 2020, he made the highlight reels when he hit a line drive into the right field corner at Chase Field in the 4th inning of a game against the Houston Astros. The ball hit an angle of the wall and rolled quickly along the warning track past RF George Springer and towards center field, where, by the time CF Myles Straw picked it up, Kole had been able to circle the bases with an inside-the-park homer. It also scored Ketel Marte from first base and started a nine-run inning in what ended up as a 14-7 win by the Diamondbacks. He was involved in another weird play on August 24th, against the Colorado Rockies, when caught in a rundown between first and second, he was hit in the helmet by a throw from C Tony Wolters, who was backing up first base, to second base. He was called out for interference, even though he did not get out of the baseline and barely moved his head. Manager Torey Lovullo was incensed and argued the call, but did not win the argument and in fact was ejected. After the game, Calhoun admitted that the umpires were right and that he had deliberately put his head in the way of the ball, knowing he would be thrown out anyway."},

He hit .357 in 11 games in his late-season call-up and impressed enough to be added to the Guardians' postseason roster. He started Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays on October 8th at DH and went 1 for 5 in the 15-inning marathon that ended in a 1-0 Cleveland win. he then appeared in four of the five games of Cleveland's loss to the New York Yankees in the Division Series going 1 for 6, his lone hit coming as a pinch-hitter in Game 3, when he also drove in a run.\n He started the 2023 season with the Guardians as the team's regular right fielder and hit well enough to keep his job. On June 9th, he ended an epic battle with the Houston Astros with the first walk-off hit of his career, a single to left that drove in the game-ending run in the 14th inning in a 10-9 win. The Guardians set a record by coming back from a deficit no less than five times from the 7th inning on, and it was only the second major league game to go that many innings since the adoption of the tiebreaker rule during the 2020 season."},

He moved quickly through the organizational ranks after starting with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers of the New York-Penn League his first year, when he had an ERA of 0.95 in 24 innings.  In 2017, he was successively with the Lake County Captains, Lynchburg Hillcats and Akron Rubber Ducks, going a combined 10-5, 2.86 in 28 games while pitching 173 1/3 innings.  He also had an eye-popping K/BB ratio of 162/10.  In 2018, he was back at Akron to begin the season, but after putting up an ERA of 1.16 in 5 starts, he earned a promotion to the AAA Columbus Clippers.  He continued his domination of minor league hitters, with an ERA of 1.05 in 5 starts.  On May 25th, he pitched a rain-shortened seven-hitting no-hitter over the Gwinnett Stripers, striking out 7 and walking none. His mastery of the strike zone was unabated, as he had 61 strikeouts and 3 walks in 65 1/3 innings. \n On May 28, 2018, less than two years after he had been drafted, Shane was promoted to the bigs, with his first start, a one-off outing designed to give Trevor Bauer an extra day of rest, scheduled for May 31st, his 23rd birthday.  He pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving up 4 runs, and was not involved in the decision as Cleveland defeated the Minnesota Twins, 9-8.  Shane was just the 6th player to make his debut on his birthday as a starting pitcher and the first since Edwin Jackson in 2003.  He earned his first win on June 17th, 4-1, over the Twins, when he was called up for an emergency start and allowed just one run in 5 2/3 innings.  In 20 appearances, including 19 starts, he went 11-5, 4.55 with 118 strikeouts in 114 2/3 innings.  He was not used in the postseason.  In 2019, he was inserted into the starting rotation after one early relief outing and was excellent in his first three starts, winning twice and allowing just 9 hits in 19 innings.  He slowed down a bit after that, but on May 19th, he pitched an absolute gem as he recorded his first career shutout, 10-0, over the Baltimore Orioles, striking out 15 and walking none.  He was named to the All-Star team as a replacement for Charlie Morton, who was unable to pitch due to the Sunday Starter rule.  He made the most of his opportunity, pitching a perfect 5th inning, during which he struck out all three batters he faced in order: Willson Contreras, Ketel Marte and Ronald Acuna. He was named the winner of the Ted Williams Award as the game's MVP. He pitched another shutout, this one a one-hitter, when he defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 1-0, on July 24th. The sole hit was a 7th-inning double by Eric Sogard, and he struck out 10 batters and walked just one. On August 4th, he threw his third complete game of the season in a 6-2 win over the Los Angeles Angels, becoming the first pitcher with that many since teammate Corey Kluber and Ervin Santana in 2017. In 34 games (33 starts), he fashioned a 15-8, 3.28 line and 4.9 bWAR mark with a robust 259 strikeouts in 214 1/3 innings. He finished fourth in the voting for the 2019 American League Cy Young Award.\n Given his success the previous season, Bieber was an obvious choice to be the opening day starter for the Indians in 2020, even if that day was delayed by almost four months until July 24th due to the coronavirus pandemic. He was at his best and looked very much the ace, striking out 14 in 6 innings in a 2-0 win over the Kansas City Royals. He then followed that on July 30th with 13 Ks in 8 scoreless innings in a 2-0 win over the Minnesota Twins. The 27 strikeouts tied the major league record, set by Karl Spooner in his first two career starts in 1954, for most K's in a pitcher's first two games of the season. The American League record had been 25, held by none other than Nolan Ryan. He continued to set records in the following weeks: on August 31st, he pitched his 50th inning of the year, at which point he had struck out 82 batters, setting another mark. He was named the American League Pitcher of the Month for August, thanks to a record of 4-0, 1.63 with 57 Ks in 38 2/3 innings. On September 11th, he recorded his 100th strikeout of the year in a 3-1 loss to the Minnesota Twins. It had taken him just 62 1/3 innings, the fewest by a starting pitcher since at least 1900. Max Scherzer had set the previous record with 63 innings in 2018. He finished the year by winning the Pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the AL in the three most prominent pitching categories: wins (8), strikeouts (122) and ERA (1.63). In fact, he led the major leagues in all three categories. He was the first pitcher since Justin Verlander in 2011 to win a Triple Crown. He was then named the unanimous winner of the 2020 American League Cy Young Award. However, in his sole postseason start against the New York Yankees in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series, he gabe up 7 runs on 9 hits in 7 2/3 innings and was charged with a loss.\n He started the 2021 season with a couple of so-so performances, giving up 5 runs in 12 1/3 innings, although with plenty of strikeouts, but in his third outing on April 13th, he was the real deal, reeling 9 shutout innings, in which he gave up 3 hits and 1 walk and struck out 11. He received credit for the Indians' 2-0 win when his teammates scored a pair of runs for him in the 10th. With his next start on April 18th, he became the first pitcher since 1893 to strike out at least 10 batters in each of his first four starts in a season. He had 13 Ks in 8 innings in a win over the Cincinnati Reds that day. It was also his sixth consecutive double-digit strikeout performance dating back to the previous season (not counting his postseason start), for an Indians record, and his 48 Ks in his first four starts tied him with Nolan Ryan in 1978. That record did not hold for long, as on April 23rd, Jacob deGrom struck out 15 batters in his fourth start of the year to push the record to 50.\n He is no relation to Canadian pop singer and teen idol Justin Bieber, but gets a lot of ribbing due to their shared last name. He used the name \"Not Justin\" as his nickname during the players' weekend in 2019. He is one of the few pitchers of his generation to throw a screwball as part of his regular arsenal."},

He was a full four years younger than the average player in the full-season Midwest League, so holding his own was already quite a feat.

In 83 1/3 innings, he gave up only 58 hits and 22 walks, for a WHIP below 1.00, while striking out 104 opponents. He began 2017 with the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. He was selected to play for the United States team in the 2017 Futures Game at Marlins Park on July 9th. he came in to start the top of the 9th with the U.S. holding a 7-4 lead over the World team and retired the only batter he faced before giving way to A.J. Puk.\n He reached the majors during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, going 2-1, 3.24 in 8 games, including 6 starts. His peripheral numbers were outstanding, with just 21 hits allowed in 33 1/3 innings, against 42 strikeouts. He made one appearance in the postseason as the Indians were swept by the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series, giving up 2 runs in 1 2/3 innings in relief. In 2021, he made 24 starts in 25 appearances, finishing at 5-9, 4.95. He again maintained a very low rate of hits allowed, with 84 in 120 innings, but he walked 58 batters and struck out 136, leading to a lot of pitches and an inability to pitch deep into games. He did a lot better in 2022 as he finished at 11-11, 2.96 in 31 games, including 30 starts. He increased his innings total to 191 1/3, his hit rate was still excellent at 138, and his K/W ratio much improved at 190/44. All of that made him one of three outstanding starting pitchers for the renamed Cleveland Guardians, alongside Shane Bieber and Cal Quantrill. He started Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays on October 8th, and pitched 6 scoreless innings, allowing just 2 hits. The game was still scoreless when he left, but the Guardians ended up 1-0 winners in 15 innings. His other start came against the Yankees in Game 3 of the Division Series on October 15th. This game did not go as well as he gave up 4 runs in 5 innings, but the Guardians still won the game, 6-5, although he was involved in the decision.\n He was ready to resume his role as one of Cleveland's big three starters in 2023 when he hit a snag in his final start of spring training, having to leave the game after just one inning, and then missing the first two months of the season. When he finally made his debut on June 4th, he was in fine form, limiting the Minnesota Twins to one hit over five innings while striking out 10. He ended up with a no-decision as Cleveland won the game, 2-1.\n Extremely tall and rail-thin, he has an explosive fastball that reaches the upper 90s."},

After spending thet first year with the DSL Nationals, he moved over to the United States in 2013, suiting up for one game each for the Auburn Doubledays of the New York-Penn League and Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League. His ERA was 16.,88, the result of giving up 7 runs in an inning and a third in his only start for Auburn. He was back with that team in 2014 and did much better, going 3-2, 0.75 in 7 starts, earning a second chance at Hagerstown, where he went 4-1, 1.33. His combined record of 7-3, 1.08 in 16 starts thus put him on the prospect radar map.\n Reynaldo spent the 2015 season in the Carolina League with the Potomac Nationals where he went 6-7, 4.09 in 19 starts. He also struck out 94 batters in 99 innings while walking only 28. In 2016, he began the season with the Harrisburg Senators of the AA Eastern League where he was 3-5, 3.18 in 14 starts. He was promoted to the AAA Syracuse Chiefs at the end of June, then played for the World team in the 2016 Futures Game at Petco Park in San Diego, CA. Things went quickly from there, as on July 19th, he was called up to the nation's capital to make his debut with the Washington Nationals, starting against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He found the going a bit rough, as he gave up 6 runs on 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings and was charged with the 8-4 loss. The first batter he faced in the majors, Chase Utley, touched him for a solo homer, but he also struck out 9 batters with his fastball reaching the upper 90's on the radar gun. He pitched 11 times for Washington, including 6 starts, going 5-3, 4.91. In 44 innings, he struck out 42 batters, and also appeared once in the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On December 8th, he was one of three young pitchers, along with Lucas Giolito and Dane Dunning, to be traded to the Chicago White Sox in return for CF Adam Eaton.\n In 2017, he went 3-3, 4.72 in 8 starts for Chicago while spending the bulk of the season with the Charlotte Knights of the International League. He then spent a full season in the Windy City in 2018, making 32 starts and pitching 188 2/3 innings while finishing up at 7-10, 3.91. His nice season went under the radar given he was pitching for a rebuilding team that was never in contention. He started off the 2019 season slowly and after 5 starts was 1-3, 7.46. On April 28th, however, he pitched a gem against the Detroit Tigers as he gave up just 2 hits and one unearned run in 6 innings, while striking out 14 batters. Three relievers - Jace Fry, Kelvin Herrera and Alex Colome - each pitched one inning and struck out two batters each to allow the Sox to be the 7th team to tie the major league record of 20 strikeouts in a nine-inning game. Lopez received credit for the 4-1 win. On August 25th, he took the mound with the flu but still managed to pitch 5 hitless innings against the Texas Rangers before he had to be taken out, feeling the ill-effects of dehydration and other symptoms. Aaron Bummer took over for him and allowed a single to the first batter he faced, Shin-Soo Choo, but that was the only hit allowed by four relievers as Lopez received credit for the 2-0 win. He had another great start on September 5th, this time against the Cleveland Indians as he pitched the first complete game of his career, spinning a one-hitter for a 7-1 win. The only hit he gave up was a double by Kevin Plawecki in the 2nd, which drove in Jake Bauers who had walked earlier in the inning. He struck out 11 and walked 3 and retired the final 16 batters he faced. he finished the season at 10-15, 5.38, leading the American League with 110 earned runs allowed.\n Lopez struggled during the abbreviated 2020 season, making 8 starts for Chicago and finishing at 1-3, 6.49. The White Sox made it to the postseason, but he did not see any action. In 2021, he made 9 starts in 20 appearances and improved to 4-4, 3.43, with 55 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings. He did play in the postseason that year, pitching a couple of innings against the Houston Astros in the Division Series, and giving up 1 run. In 2022, he was a full-time reliever, making just 1 start in 61 appearances and putting up good numbers. He went 6-4, 2.76, logging 65 1/3 innings and striking out 63 batters while allowing just 11 walks. He was back in the same role in 2023, making 40 appearances out of the bullpen in the season's first four months. His numbers were not as good, as he was 2-5, 4.29, although he did pick up the first 4 saves of his career. On July 26th he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels alongside fellow veteran pitcher Lucas Giolito in return for two prospects, P Ky Bush and C Edgar Quero."},

He first sprinted 76 feet at full speed to catch a fly ball off the bat of Justin Upton of the Los Angeles Angels, then made a throw clear across the field with pinpoint accuracy to double up Eric Young Jr. at first base. The ball traveled 321 feet on the fly from left field to first, according to Statcast. He quickly became a fixture in the A's lineup as they were battling for a postseason slot. On September 7th, he had the second two-homer game of his career in leading the A's to an 8-4 win over the Texas Rangers, the first having come against those same Rangers on August 20th. That made him the first player in team history with two multi-homer games over his first 30 games. He hit .288 in 48 games, with 27 runs, 5 homers and 19 RBIs. He started in centerfield for the A's in the Wild Card Game against the New York Yankees on October 3rd and went 0 for 3 with a walk in a 7-2 loss.\n He displayed his outstanding throwing arm again in an early-season series against the Boston Red Sox in April 2019. In a four-game series, he picked up three outfield assists, each one more impressive than the last. He was a huge factor in the A's winning three of the four games, and some observers began dubbing him \"Laser Ramon\", a reference to former wresting superstar \"Razor Ramon\". On April 21st, he added to his reel of highlight plays in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays as he robbed Teoscar Hernandez of a home run by reaching over the fence in the 2nd inning, then whirled around and threw to first base, where he overthrew the bag, but C Nick Hundley was backing up the play, and managed to throw out Justin Smoak at second base for a spectacular double play. On May 7th, he robbed Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds of a home run with a perfectly-timed leap over the centerfield fence at the Oakland Coliseum; it was a particularly important catch as it allowed Mike Fiers to pitch a no-hitter that day. He ended up playing 123 games and hitting .288 with 24 homers and 67 RBIs. His OPS+ of 128 was almost identical to that he had posted in his rookie year. In the Wild Card Game, he went 1 for 3 with an RBI as the A's lost at that stage for the second straight year, this time against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n On August 9 2020, he was at the center of a major brawl between the A's and their main rivals, the Houston Astros. After having been hit by a pitch for a second time in that game, he was taunted by Astros' coach Alex Cintrón, initiating a bench-clearing brawl. He later explained that he had not been looking for trouble, but that Cintrón had used an obscenity while referring to his mother and that he could not let that pass. In any case, MLB had already warned everyone that it would punish such incidents severely in a year when social distancing was the by-word, and Laureano was handed a stiff six-game suspension. For his part, Cintrón received an exemplary twenty-game sentence, as he was identified as the instigator of the brawl, and it was underlined that as a coach, he bore a greater degree of responsibility for his actions. In 54 games, he hit .213 with 6 homers and 25 RBIs, also leading the American League with 12 hit by pitch. His OPS+ of 98, the lowest of his career. He then went a combined 5 for 26 in the postseason, with 2 homers and 5 RBIs. He was having a bounceback season in 2021, hitting .246 in 88 games, with 14 homers, 39 RBIs and an OPS+ of 112 when on August 6th, he was suspended for 80 games for testing positive for Nandrolone, a performance-enhancing substance. He claimed that he had not knowingly taken the banned substance."},

That came after successive appearances in the College World Series in 2017 and 2018, being part of the title-winning team the second year. He showed prowess as a high-average hitter both in college and in the minors, batting .300 or better as a sophomore and a junior at Oregon State, in the Cape Cod League, in his first pro season in 2018, and again in 2021 after being forced to sit out the previous year by the COVID-19 pandemic. The only exception came in 2019 with the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League, when he batted .280/.353/.382 in 123 games. In 2021, he batted .328 with an OBP of.407 between AA and AAA, and even slugged .527 in 77 games.\n The now-renamed Cleveland Guardians added him to their 40-man roster after the 2021 season, and he had an outstanding spring training in 2022, earning not only a spot of the Opening Day roster, but started in right field in the team's first game gainst the Kansas City Royals on April 7th. He went 1 for 2 with a pair of walks that day. He broke out in his third game, getting five hits in a 17-3 demolition of the Royals in what was the first victory of the Guardians era for Cleveland. After his first three games, he had reached base in 12 of 14 plate appearances! he made it 15 times reaching base in four games with another standout performance on April 11th as he drew a pair of walks and hit his first career triple in a 10-7 win over Kansas City; the triple came with the bases loaded in the 8th inning. No player since 1901 had ever matched the 15 times reaching base in his first four career games. He reached base three more times in his fifth game, this one against the Cincinnati Reds on April 12th, and still had not swung and missed even once since the start of the season. Not only had he yet to strike out either, but he hadn't done so in spring training either and one had to go back to a minor league game on September 21st for his last whiff. He had a single and two walks in the game, and one of the plate appearances in which he did not reach base was still a productive one as it resulted in a sacrifice fly. He finally did miss a pitch he swung at in his first at-bat of his next game, but still produced a foul tip that was caught by Tyler Stephenson - 116 pitches into his career; he struck out looking four pitches later, the first K of his career. He cooled down a bit after that, but was still named the American League Rookie of the Month for April, finishing the month at .354 with an OBP of .459. He hit his first major league homer on May 5th, a two-run shot off José Berríos of the Toronto Blue Jays. He closed off the year as he started it, winning the Rookie of the Month Award for the second time in September by batting .325 with 3 homers and 14 RBIs as the Guardians clinched a division title."},

His father Greg Zunino hit over .300 in his minor league career before becoming a scout while his uncle Gary Zunino played professionally as well.\n Mike played in the AFLAC All-American High School Baseball Game in 2008. As a high school junior, he hit .457 and slugged .897 and made All-State. His senior year, he batted .464/.531/.918 with 12 homers and was All-State again. The Oakland Athletics took him in the 30th round of the 2009 amateur draft but he opted for college. In his freshman year at Florida, he batted .267/.314/.472 and played in the 2010 College World Series. He was named the Freshman All-American catcher by Baseball America.\n As a sophomore, Zunino improved to .371/.442/.674 with 19 home runs, 75 runs and 67 RBI in 72 games. He led the Southeastern Conference in total bases (178), hits (98), runs, doubles (23, tied with Preston Tucker) and home runs, was second in slugging (to Mikie Mahtook), OPS (behind Mahtook) and RBI (7 behind Tucker) and tied for third in average. He ranked among the NCAA Division I leaders in slugging (20th, right behind fellow catcher Kevan Smith), home runs (tied for 7th), RBI (tied for 18th), doubles (tied for 18th), runs (3rd after Jake Lowery and Tyler Robbins and total bases (third after Lowery and Victor Roache). He was named SEC Player of the Year, only the second Florida Gator to do so (Matt LaPorta had won twice). He also was named first-team All-American at catcher by both Baseball America and the American Baseball Coaches Association. Collegiate Baseball picked Lowery instead. In the 2011 College World Series, Florida went to the finals. In the first game of the best-of-3 finals, Zunino was on base in the 9th in a 1-1 game but was thrown out at home by Scott Wingo. In the 11th, he made a crucial error, throwing the ball into center field and allowing Christian Walker to score the winning run for South Carolina. In game 2, he was 3 for 3 with a homer but Florida lost, 5-2. He also was 10 for 33 with 2 doubles and 3 walks for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in the Cape Cod League. \n He was the top college player selected in the 2012 amateur draft, with the third overall pick, following the selections of high schoolers Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton. The day after his selection in the draft, he was named as one of three finalists for the 2012 Golden Spikes Award. He won the Dick Howser Trophy as well and then took home the Golden Spikes Award. He signed with the Mariners in early July for a $4 million bonus.\n Zunino was initially assigned to the Everett AquaSox in 2012 but was clearly well above the rest of the league, hitting .373/.474/.737 with 10 home runs, 29 runs and 35 RBI in 29 games (the only negative being 7 passed balls). That performance let him skip two levels and go straight to AA with the Jackson Generals, where he hit .333 in 15 games to end the season. He was assigned to the AAA Tacoma Rainiers at the start of 2013 and hit .227/.297/.478 in 52 games. He hit 12 doubles, 3 triples and 11 homers during that span, even though his BA and OBP were rather low. He got the call to Seattle earlier than expected, on June 11th, because another top catching prospect, Jesus Montero, had not fulfilled expectations.\n He made his major league debut on June 12, 2013 as the starting catcher against the Houston Astros, going 1 for 4. Facing Jordan Lyles, he struck out in his first at-bat, but lined a single to center for his first big league hit his second time up. He was hitting .242 after 49 games when he was placed on the disabled list with a broken bone in his right hand on July 26th. He had been injured while swinging the bat the previous day and had to undergo surgery, missing six weeks of action. He came back in the first days of September and played regularly over the last month, although he did not hit much, ending the year with a .214 average, 5 homers and 14 RBIs in 52 games. He was the Mariners' opening day catcher in 2014 and got the bulk of the playing time while sharing duties with veteran John Buck. On April 29th, he had the first four-hit game of his career, going 4-for-5 with an RBI and a run scored in a 6-3 win over the New York Yankees. He played 131 games that season, but hit only .199 in spite of 22 home runs and 60 RBIs.\n In 2015, he played 112 games as the Mariners' starting catcher, but continued to struggle with a low batting average, hitting only .174. His power fell as well, as he hit 11 homers and drove in 28 runs. His OPS+ had been 88 in 2014 - poor, but acceptable for a good defensive catcher, but was an awful 48 that season. The Mariners' brass was very concerned about the apparent regression of someone who was seen as a key part of the team. In 2016, he played only 55 games and while he hit only .207 - still a major improvement over the previous two years - he displayed very good power, with 7 doubles and 12 homers, giving him an OPS+ of 112. He was still striking out too much - 65 times in 164 at bats, after compiling totals of 158 and 132 the previous two years, but there was some hope. He also played 79 games in the minors, where he hit a solid .286 with 17 homers and 57 RBIs. In 2017, he got another opportunity to start, but he continued to strike out too much with a very low batting average, and was sent down to AAA for a couple of weeks in May. On his return, he had a great game on June 3rd when he hit a grand slam and drove in 7 runs in a 9-2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. That game marked the start of a hot streak as he hit .338 with 9 homers and 28 RBIs over his first 22 games following his return from the minors. That included a pair of two-homer games on June 4th and June 19th. In June, he had already set a new franchise record for most RBIs in any month by a catcher with 26 - with ten days still to go in the month. He finished the season with a .251 average - by far the best of his career - and 25 homers and 64 RBIs in 124 games. His control of the strike zone was still less than optimal, with 39 walks and 160 Ks, but he did enough when he did make contact to be a sold offensive contributor, with an OPS+ of 125.\n Zunino regressed badly in 2018, the year the Mariners thought they would finally make it back to the postseason. They started off hot but then cooled down and were passed by the surprising Oakland Athletics. He was one of the players singled out for underperforming, as his batting average fell back to .201, his K/W rate was a dismal 24/150 and while he hit 18 doubles and 20 homers, his OPS+ was just 85. After the season, on November 8th, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays, along with OF Guillermo Heredia, another disappointment, in return for OFs Jake Fraley and Mallex Smith. He played 90 games for Tampa in 2019, hitting just .165 with 9 homers and 32 RBIs in 90 games. Officially, he was considered the team's regular catcher, but he was thoroughly eclipsed by Chase d'Arnaud, who was brought in as a reclamation project after a few weeks and outhit him by a wide margin. D'Arnaud started all of Tampa's postseason games while Zunino did not see any action. It looked like that was the end of his stint as a Ray, but d'Arnaud left the team as a free agent following his successful re-birth, and Tampa decided to re-sign Mike on the cheap to at least have a veteran catcher around in 2020."},

He was rumored to be a possible call-up to the big league team in spite of his lack of pro experience - something that happened to C Alejandro Kirk, who was in a similar situation, but the Blue Jays did not pull the trigger. \n He again impressed in spring training in 2021, but was still assigned to the AA New Hampshire Fisher Cats. He did not put up glowing numbers, going 2-4, 5.76 in 11 starts, but like the previous year, he had the sort of experience worth a fortune in development time when he was selected to be part of Team USA for both the 2020 Americas Olympics Qualifier and then for the 2020 Olympics themselves after the U.S. successfully qualified. In fact, he was in Tokyo with the team when on July 30th, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins along with another top Jays prospect, OF-IF Austin Martin, to acquire front-line starter José Berríos. Interestingly, he was not the first US Olympic team pitcher to go at the trade deadline, as Joe Ryan had just been traded. A third pitcher, Jeremy Reed, was traded while his wife was playing softball for the US squad. He went 1-1, 6.75 in 4 games for the AA Wichita Wind Surge after the trade.\n When he made his major league debut for the Twins on October 2, 2022, he became the holder of the longest last name to appear in the majors, with 15 (not counting the hyphen); that beat the 14 letters of Jarrod Saltalamacchia. The letters almost formed a full circle around his uniform number, 78. In his debut, he gave up 3 runs on 3 hits in 5 innings against the Detroit Tigers and was charged with a 5-2 loss. He had split the season between AA Wichita and the AAA St. Paul Saints, going 5-3, 2.77 in 23 games, allowing just 77 hits in 107 1/3 innings while striking out 115 batters. His name record did not even last a year, as it was topped when Christian Encarnacion-Strand made his debut the following July."},

In 2015, he made 22 starts between three teams, the AZL Mariners, the Clinton LumberKings and the Bakersfield Blaze. His combined record was 4-8, 4.10, logging 96 2 /3 innings and recording 88 strikeouts. In 2016, he moved up to the Jackson Generals of the AA Texas League, where he was a solid 12-4, 2.95 in 25 games, all starts. He had 99 Ks and 31 BBs in 128 1/3 innings and was named the league's Pitcher of the Year. On January 11, 2017, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays along with 18-year-old infield prospect Carlos Vargas and OF Mallex Smith in return for major league starting pitcher Drew Smyly.\n Yarbrough made his major league debut with the Rays at the beginning of the 2018 season, pitching 4 innings and giving up just one run in a relief appearance that was part of a \"bullpen start\" against the Boston Red Sox. He continued to pitch in long relief with the occasional bullpen start thrown in, so that in his first 10 appearances, he had 7 games of between 4 and 5 innings, but none longer, in spite of making just three starts. That unusual usage pattern continued on May 19th, when he had the longest outing of his career thus far after he replaced short reliever Sergio Romo, who was making the first start of his career after 588 relief appearances, after the veteran had pitched a perfect 1st inning, striking out the side against the Los Angeles Angels. He took the relay and pitched six scoreless innings before giving up a run in the 8th and leaving after 6 1/3 innings. He received credit for the Rays' 5-3 win, his 4th of the year, with three having come in long relief and one as a starter. On August 20th, he was th winner in a 1-0 defeat of the Kansas City Royals in another long relief appearance as part of a bullpen day. This time he pitched 5 1/3 innings and recorded his 10th relief win of the season, and 12th overall against just 5 losses as he had taken to his unusual role like a fish to water. His 96 relief innings were the most in the majors and he was almost certain at that point to be the first reliever to top 100 innings since Scott Proctor in 2006. The Rays' players devised a name for his pioneering role on the pitching staff, calling him the \"bulk man\", i.e. he was the one pitching the bulk of innings on days he worked, although he was not the starting pitcher (or the \"opener\" as the Rays called those who pitched the 1st inning but were not expected to get much beyond the 2nd or 3rd before being replaced). \n It was in the role of \"bulk man\" that Yarbrough almost put his name in the record books on July 14, 2019. The Rays' most reliable opener, Ryne Stanek started that day's game with 2 perfect innings against the Baltimore Orioles, then passed the ball on to Ryan, who was outstanding. He reeled off six perfect innings to take the perfect game bid into the 9th inning. It would have been the first combined perfect game in major league history, but the O's Hanser Alberto broke it up by leading off the 9th with a single. It was not a hard-hit ball either, as he simply took advantage of a defensive shift to push a ground ball in the hole left where the second baseman would normally have been standing in a normal defensive alignment. Alberto eventually came in to score as two other pitcher, Oliver Drake and Emilio Pagan, completed the inning, but Ryan received credit for the 4-1 win. On August 11th, he came within one out of his first career shutout against his former team, the Mariners. He got through 8 2/3 innings and had retired the last 14 batters in order when, with a 1-0 lead, manager Kevin Cash took him out in favor of Emilio Pagan, who recorded the final out. His pitch count was just 99, but it was the longest outing of his career. He confessed after the game that he was a little miffed that he hadn't been allowed to get the final out, but Cash explained that he was suitably impressed with his performance and simply wanted to win the game. The win improved his record to 11-3.\n On June 3, 2021, he pitched a 9-inning complete game in a 9-2 win over the New York Yankees. It was the first complete game thrown by a Rays pitcher since Matt Andriese had done so on May 14, 2016 - over five years earlier! He went 9-7, 5.11 that season, making 21 starts in 30 appearances and logging 155 innings. The rays finished first in the AL East, but he did not appear in any postseason games. In 2022, his ERA improved to 4.50, but his record was only 3-8 as he made 9 starts in 20 appearances, pitching 80 innings. Once again, he did not appear in the postseason. He became a free agent after the season and on December 13th signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Royals for $3 million.\n On May 7, 2023, he was hit in the face by a line drive off the bat of Ryan Noda, of the Oakland Athletics. He was immediately taken out of the game and was diagnosed with multiple facial fractures, but still received credit for his first win of the season, as he had completed the mandatory five innings before the accident."},

He was taken by the club in the 9th round of the 2012 amateur draft.\n The hurler dominated the league his first two professional seasons. In 2012, he was 0-2 with 13 saves, 47 strikeouts in 30 2/3 innings and a 1.17 ERA in 23 games between the Jamestown Jammers and Greensboro Grasshoppers, earning a spot on the New York-Penn League Mid-Season All-Star team. With the Jupiter Hammerheads and Jacksonville Suns in 2013, he was 2-1 with 26 saves, 63 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings, 39 games finished and a 0.77 ERA in 52 appearances. He was named a Florida State League Mid- and Post-Season All-Star, a MiLB.com Organization All-Star and a member of the Arizona Fall League All-Prospect Team. \n He spent 2014 with the Suns and had a solid - though not dominant - season, going 5-5, 3.55 with 20 saves in 52 games and averaging less than a strikeout per inning (56 in 66 innings). In 2015, he began the year with two appearances at Jacksonville before being promoted to the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs for the remainder of the season. There he was 1-6, 3.03 in 52 games, with 19 saves. He struck out 64 in 62 1/3 innings. \n He made his major league debut with the Marlins on April 19, 2016. He had been called up from New Orleans that same day when Edwin Jackson was placed on the disabled list. Facing the Washington Nationals, his debut came in a historic 7th inning, as the Marlins allowed a team record four home runs in the frame, which was also a team record for the Nats. The game was still scoreless when Adam Conley allowed a solo homer to Jayson Werth with one out, and then another one to the next batter, Wilson Ramos; after a second out, he gave up a single to his opponent, Stephen Strasburg and a double to Michael Taylor, ending his night's work. Nick came in to replace him, but he walked the only batter he faced, Anthony Rendon, on a full count. Chris Narveson replaced him on the mound, and he coughed up a grand slam to Bryce Harper and then a solo homer to Ryan Zimmerman. Those were all the runs scored in the game as Washington won, 7-0 and Nick was left with an infinite ERA after that outing. He pitched a total of 48 times that season, going 4-3, 3.14. In 2017, he went 3-1, 4.68 in 38 games for the Marlins, then in 2018, he improved to 2-1, 2.94 in 32 games. He also pitched in the minors at New Orleans in both 2017 and 2018, and at AA Jacksonville for a couple of games in 2018.\n On February 4, 2019, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in return for minor leaguer Jordan Milbrath. he was 5-1 with four saves and a 2.81 ERA for the Indians that summer (pitching two games in the minors as well). He was their fourth-most-used hurler, after Adam Cimber, Oliver Pérez and Brad Hand. He turned three double plays; only Zach Greinke and Will Harris turned more by a pitcher in the 2019 AL. He was 2-0 with a 3.42 ERA in the COVID-19-shortened 2020 with 28 K in 23 2/3 IP. He had 1.6 Win Probability Added, 7th in the 2020 AL, between Lance Lynn and Hand. He struggled at 2-9, 5.05 with a save in 2021, though his 60 outings tied James Karinchak for third on the staff.\n A free agent, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals but his decline continued as he was 1-0 with a save and 5.90 ERA in 29 games in 2022. Being of German descent, he pitched for the German national team in the 2022 World Baseball Classic Qualifiers. His two appearances tied Duke Von Schamann and Jordan Martinson for the team lead. In his debut, he relieved Von Schamann in the 6th with a 5-1 deficit, no outs and a man on third against Great Britain. He got Harry Ford on a sacrifice fly, walked Matt Koperniak and retired Nick Ward and Justin Wylie. Maurice Wilhelm replaced him in the 7th. His other outing, he replaced Martinson in the 6th with a 2-2 game against South Africa, two outs and none on. He got Brandon Bouillon on a liner. After Germany scored seven in the bottom of the frame, he was relieved by Sascha Koch, who saved Wittgren's win over Kevin Townend. He got Germany's lone win in the event.\n That winter, he was very sharp for the Águilas Cibaeñas (4 H, 3 BB, 9 K, 0 R in 8 IP). The Kansas City Royals signed him for 2023."},

He was coming off an outstanding season at Colleyville Heritage High School in Colleyville, TX and was really the only other player mentioned as a potential first overall pick apart from C Adley Rutschman of Oregon State University, whom the Baltimore Orioles selected just before him. Because his father was picked #3 in the 1985 amateur draft, it made the two the highest father-son combination ever drafted, besting that of Tom Grieve (#6 in 1966) and Ben Grieve (#2 in 1994). On June 9th, it was reported that he had agreed to sign with the Royals for a bonus of $7.8 million.\n He was considered to have excellent defensive tools that made him a natural shortstop, in addition to some of the best hitting ability of any high schooler that year, with above average power. He was also an excellent pitcher, hitting the upper 90s on the radar gun, although he was not looked at seriously as a pitcher given his other skills. It was also noted that he had a tremendous work ethic and was particularly well grounded for a young player of such talent. As a high school senior, he hit .489 with 15 homers and was named the Gatorade National High School Player of the Year.\n In his first professional season in 2019, he played 37 games for the AZL Royals, hitting .262 with 1 homer and 27 RBIs, and also 5 triples. It was a good start to his pro career, but his 2020 season was wiped out by the Coronavirus pandemic which shut down the minor leagues. Still, as one of the top prospects in the Royals system, he was kept in the group of players playing practice games at the team's alternate training site, so he could at least work out with some top competition. Still he had very little professional game experience when he showed up in spring training with the major league team as a non-roster invitee in 2020. It was clear however that he was a special talent, to the point that the team's brass had to explain that they had not completely excluded his making the team's roster. He was clearly seen as the Royals' second baseman of the future, playing alongside SS Adalberto Mondesi and hitting either first or second in the lineup. Still, going straight from Rookie-class ball to the majors would have been a huge - albeit not unprecedented - step and on March 21st, the Royals announced he would open the season in the minors. He was slugging .526 after 14 games, so he was clearly not outmatched.\n He started the 2021 season with the AA Northwest Arkansas Naturals, but did not immediately set the world on fire as he hit .209 over his first 21 games, with 30 strikeouts. On May 30th, however, he had the first three-homer game of his professional career, after having also homered the night before. On June 8th, the same night when Ke'Bryan Hayes made blooper reels across the country for having a home run taken away from him because he failed to touch first base, he made a similar mistake. In his case, it was his second homer of the game, and the base he has supposedly missed touching was home plate. He was called out on appeal by home plate umpire Chris Presley-Murphy, but in his case, the video evidence was far from clear, and he insisted after the game that he had, indeed, touched home as required. The home run that stood gave him a league-leading 10 on the season. The other would-be homer ended up being counted as a triple. He was named to represent the American League at the 2021 Futures Game. Shortly after the game, on July 17th, he was promoted to the AAA Omaha Storm Chasers along with fellow prospect Nick Pratto, who as also fresh off a participation in the Futures Game. In 60 games for the Naturals, he had hit .292 with 16 homers and 50 RBIs. He then played one more game in AA before earning a promotion to the AAA Omaha Storm Chasers, where he continued his outstanding production, batting .,285 with 17 homers. Overall, in 123 games, he hit .290/.361/.575 with 33 homers, 35 doubles and 29 stolen bases. He was named the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year after the season.\n Heading into spring training in 2022, he was named the #1 prospect on MLB's Top 100 Prospects list. This time there was a very real possibility of his breaking camp with the major league team and indeed this was confirmed by the Royals on April 5th. He was the Royals' starting third baseman and number 2 hitter against the Cleveland Guardians on Opening Day on April 7th. In the best Hollywood style, he was the game's hero when in the 8th inning, his first big league hit was a double off Triston McKenzie that drove in Michael Taylor with the go-ahead run, and shortly afterwards he came around to score an insurance run in a 3-1 Royals win. Despite that textbook debut, he struggled in his first few weeks in the Show, batting just .216 with 5 RBIs in 19 April games. He finally hit his first home run on May 3rd, off Dakota Hudson of the St. Louis Cardinals. He had started to turn things around by that point, as the long ball gave him an 11-game hitting streak. He had back-to-back excellent games on May 27-28, going 3-for-5 in both games against the Minnesota Twins, with a triple and a homer in the first game, and three doubles in the second. He had his first multi-homer game on June 21st, in one of the wildest games of the year that saw KC beat the Los Angeles Angels, 12-11, in 11 innings. He drove in 5 runs, but Shohei Ohtani stole the spotlight with 2 homers of his own and 8 RBIs in a losing cause. On July 11th, he collected six hits in a doubleheader sweep of the Detroit Tigers, including his first career four-hit game inthe nitecap. He also drove in 3 runs and stole three bases in what was a great day overall. On September 3rd, he hit his 20th homer and thus became the fifth rookie to have a season of 20 homers and 20 stolen bases. On September 13th, he broke up a bid for a combined no-hitter by Minnesota Twins pitchers Joe Ryan and Jovani Moran with a one-out double off Moran in the 9th. He finished the year at .254 in 150 games, with 31 doubles, 6 triples and 20 homers, 82 runs and 82 RBIs. His OPS+ was 102 and he was named to the 2022 Topps All-Star Rookie Team as the third baseman (he played 55 games at the hot corner and 98 at shortstop), with Jeremy Peña of the Houston Astros winning the nod at shortstop. He also finished 4th in the voting for the 2022 American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind winner Julio Rodríguez, Rutschman, the man taken ahead of him in the 2019 amateur draft, and Steven Kwan, with Peña finishing behind him.\n In 2023, he had an excellent season for a very weak Royals team, becoming a member of the 30-30 club for the first time. He entered the elite fraternity on September 29th, when he belted his 30th homer, having already reached 30 stolen bases long before that (in fact, he was at 49 steals at that point and still had a chance at accomplishing a very rare 30-50 season). He was the third player to join the club that year, following the much more publicized Ronald Acuna and Julio Rodríguez. He was also the American League leader in triples and generally improved his numbers across the board over his rookie year, when he had already posted solid totals. In spite of this, he was not named to the All-Star team, in large part because his teammate, catcher Salvador Perez, was a lock, and the Royals were playing too poorly to justify taking two spots on the AL roster.\n In addition to his father's time in professional baseball, he is the brother-in-law of three major leaguers, each married to one of his sisters: James Russell, married to Nikki; Zach Neal, married to Kianna,; and Cody Thomas, married to Shaley. His uncle Doug Witt was a bullpen catcher for the Texas Rangers and later became a scout."},

[1] He was the Atlanta Braves' second-round pick in the 2017 amateur draft after they took Kyle Wright in round one. The scout was Dustin Evans. [2] The center fielder split the summer between the GCL Braves (.347/.448/.571 in 14 G) and Danville Braves (.255/.331/.383 in 36 G). Baseball America rated him as the #9 prospect in the Appalachian League, between teammates Kyle Muller and William Contreras. [3]\n He split 2018 between the Rome Braves (.303/.353/.513 in 84 G) and Florida Fire Frogs (.268/.316/.374 in 30 G). For the year, he had 72 runs, 39 doubles, 9 triples and 23 steals in 28 tries. Two negatives were 8 errors and 29 walks. He tied Cole Freeman and Ryan Kirby for 6th in the South Atlantic League with 32 doubles. He joined Seuly Matias and Casey Golden as the SAL All-Star outfielders. Baseball America rated him as the league's #3 prospect (behind D.L. Hall and Luis Garcia). [4] They also rated him the best defensive outfielder in the SAL and the fastest baserunner. [5] He was among the Braves chain leaders in runs (tied for 1st with Rio Ruiz), doubles (1st, 7 ahead of Austin Riley), triples (tied for 1st with Justin Dean), steals (2nd, 4 behind Ray-Patrick Didder) and OPS (3rd among those with 400+ PA, behind Michael Reed and Dean). Baseball America listed him as the 83rd-best prospect in baseball entering 2019.\n Waters played in 2019 for the Mississippi Braves (.319/.366/.481 in 108 G) and Gwinnett Stripers (.271/.336/.374 in 26 G). Making AAA at age 20, he finished the year with 80 runs, 40 doubles, 9 triples and 16 steals in 22 tries. He joined Brandon Marsh, Cristian Pache and Pavin Smith as the Southern League All-Star outfielders. He led the SL in average (.018 ahead of Patrick Leonard and Daulton Varsho), doubles (one ahead of Jhoan Urena) and triples (one ahead of Pache and Lucius Fox). He was 3rd in total bases (202, 4 behind leader Varsho), 2nd in OPS (52 behind Varsho), 8th in OBP and 2nd in slugging (.039 behind Varsho, even though he only hit 5 homers for Mississippi). He was named the league's MVP. Baseball America rated him as the SL's #5 prospect, between Sixto Sanchez and Brendan McKay. [6] They also named him the best batting prospect in the loop. [7] The Atlanta native finished among his home town's organizational leaders in runs (80, tied for 3rd with Greg Cullen), hits (163, 1st, 11 ahead of Trey Harris), doubles (40, 1st, 4 ahead of Pache), triples (9, tied for 1st with Pache and Dean), steals (16, 6th) and whiffs (164, 2nd, 5 behind Drew Lugbauer).\n He then made the US team for the 2019 Premier 12. His leadoff homer off Rob Cordemans was the first hit of the tournament (after the Dutch national team went down 1-2-3 in the top of the 1st). He went 0 for 8 the rest of the event, though, and was relegated to the role of defensive sub in center as Jo Adell, Brent Rooker and Mark Payton got the bulk of the action in the outfield. Oddly, for a contact hitter without much home run punch, his lone hit had been a dinger. In the Bronze Medal Game, with a spot in the 2020 Olympics at stake, he came in as the center fielder in the 7th, Adell moving to LF and Payton to RF as Rooker left the game. Waters got to the plate in the 10th with two in scoring position and one out and was intentionally walked by Carlos Bustamante but was stranded and the US lost in the bottom of the inning. [8]\n After sitting out the 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic, he spent all of 2021 in AAA with Gwinnett, where he hit .240/.329/.381 with 11 homers and 37 RBIs in 103 games, numbers that were a bit of a disappointment after his performance in 2019. He was a member of the National League team at the 2021 Futures Game. In 2022, he played 49 games with Gwinnett and 3 more on a rehabilitation assignment with the Rome Braves before he was traded to the Kansas City Royals on July 11th. He was hitting .253 at the time and had risen to be the #1 prospect in the Braves system. However, he was packaged along with two other minor leaguers, Andrew Hoffmann and C.J. Alexander, in return for the #35 overall pick in the 2022 amateur draft. He made his major league debut with the Royals on August 22nd, starting in right field against the Chicago White Sox. He went 0 for 3 but drove in the go-ahead run in a 6-4 win by drawing a bases loaded walk in the 8th inning."},

After losing the 2020 season to the COVID-19 pandemic, he headed to the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League in the winter of 2020-21 just to get some game time, and hit a lot better when he joined the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of what was then called the Double-A Northeast in 2021. He hit .294 in 87 games, with 17 doubles, 16 homers and 52 RBIs, re-establishing himself as a prospect. Before the trade in 2022, he hit .258 in 70 games for the AAA Buffalo Bisons, but he was injured when traded and never got to play a game in the Royals' system that season.\n He got off to a strong start with the Omaha Storm Chasers in 2023, batting .304 with an OBP of .406 in his first 62 games and was called up to the big club on June 16th after Vinnie Pasquantino was declared lost for the remainder of the season. He made his debut the next day, starting in left field and wearing number 0 against the Los Angeles Angels. He went 1 for 3 with a walk and his first major league hit was a walk-off winner that drove in Maikel Garcia from third base in the bottom of the 9th. The 10-9 win snapped a ten-game losing streak for Kansas City, that had tumbled past the up-to-then awful Oakland Athletics to claim the worst record in the majors. The hit came against reliever Chris Devenski after the Royals had managed to tie the game earlier that inning."},

In spite of his young age, he played a full 67 games with the DSL Padres that year, hitting .267 with 4 homers and 37 RBIs. In 2013, he hit .315 in 45 games for the AZL Padres, and .205 in 12 games for the Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League. He moved up to full-season ball in 2014, with the Fort Wayne Tincaps of the Midwest League. There he played 128 games and hit .248/.301/.268, with 24 doubles and 11 homers, numbers that were more impressive than they seemed given he was 3.5 years younger than the average player in the circuit.\n In 2015, Franmil was back with Fort Wayne but it was a season of stagnation, as he hit .255/.320/.393 with 8 homers and 62 RBIs in 123 games, not showing the type of improvement that would have been expected from a young player repeating the level. In 2016, he was moved up to the Lake Elsinore Storm of the California League and did show some progression, with a line of .278/.340/.452 in 130 games, with 32 doubles, 16 homers and 83 RBIs. He had begun to fill out his large frame by then and was showing all the signs of developing into a feared power hitter. In 2017, he did that with the San Antonio Missions of the AA Texas League. In 135 games, he hit .258/.322/.464 with 27 doubles and 25 homers. He also scored 79 runs and drove in 102. In 2018 he continued his steady progression up the organizational ladder by heading to the AAA El Paso Chihuahuas. The plan may have been to give him a full season at that level as well, but his scorching bat changed these, as after 35 games, he was hitting .346 with 14 homers and 37 RBIs. On May 14th, he was called up to San Diego to make his big league debut. The 14 homers were leading all minor leagues at that point. He made his debut that day, starting in right field and going 0 for 4 against the Colorado Rockies. he became one of the few positive stories on the Padres that season, as he slowly took over as the starter in right field and showed some solid batting skills. On September 3rd, he had the first multi-homer game of his career and drove in 4 runs to lead San Diego to a 6-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. That gave him 15 long balls on the year, in just 180 at-bats. he finished his rookie season at .280 with 16 homers and 31 RBIs in 87 games. His OPS+ was an excellent 131.\n The Padres were much improved in 2019, with the signing of free agent Manny Machado to play 3B and the addition of top rookies like SS Fernando Tatis Jr. and P Chris Paddack. Reyes was the regular rightfielder for the first four months of the season, playing 99 games and hitting .255 with 27 homers and 46 RBIs. While his OPS+ was again very good, at 121, the Padres were concerned about his low RBI total in spite of copious long balls and his relatively high strikeout numbers, hovering just below one per game. On July 30th, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians, alongside P Logan Allen and prospect Victor Nova, in return for top OF prospect Taylor Trammell, who was obtained from the Cincinnati Reds, who landed P Trevor Bauer in the blockbuster three-team deal. His production went down slightly in his 51 games for Cleveland, with a .237 average, 10 homers and an OPS+ of 96, but he also drove in 35 runs. Overall, his numbers were pretty good, with 37 homers, 69 runs and 81 RBIs in 150 games, with an OPS+ of 112. In 2020, the season was cut to just 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic. He appeared in all but one of those games and had a solid year, hitting .275 with 10 doubles and 9 homers, driving in 39 runs and putting up an OPS+ of 113. He was second on the Indians in both homers and RBIs, trailing only MVP candidate Jose Ramirez in both categories. In the postseason, he went 0 for 7 with a pair of runs on two walks as the Indians were defeated by the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series.\n He had a very good season with the Indians in 2021, batting .254 in 115 games with 30 homers and 85 RBIs as their primary DH. His OPS+ was a very good 128. Big things were expected from him again as Cleveland played its first season under the \"Guardians\" moniker in 2022, but he could never get his bat going. In 70 games, he hit .213, with only 9 doubles and 9 homers, driving in 28 runs, his OPS+ tumbling to 72. Counted on to be a big power bat in the middle of the line-up, he failed completely and on August 6th, in a bit of an unexpected move, the Guardians decided to change tacks, having him designated for assignment in the hope of being able to send him down to AAA for him to work on regaining his swing. They had apparently tried to move him at the trading deadline a few days earlier, but had found no takers."},

The pick was compensation for the Rangers losing Yovani Gallardo to free agency. He was the Rangers' highest draftee that year, as they had lost their first-round pick for signing free agent Ian Desmond.\n In his first professional season, in 2016, he made only 4 appearances and pitched a total of 7 2/3 innings for the AZL Rangers. In 2017, he made 13 starts for the Spokane Indians of the Northwest League, going 3-2, 3.61 and pitching 57 1/ 3 innings. He struck out a very impressive 87 batters during the season. In 2018, he was scheduled to pitch in a full-season league for the first time, but during a spring training intrasquad game, he felt pain in his elbow. He was diagnosed with a torn ligament and had to undergo Tommy John surgery on March 28th, wiping out his season.\n He made his major league debut with the Rangers on August 4, 2022 as the starting pitcher against the Chicago White Sox. He gave up just 1 unearned run in 5 innings and was not involved in the decision as Texas won the game, 3-2. In that same game, another #1 pick by the Rangers, Bubba Thompson, also made his debut as the starting left fielder. He went 0-3, 4.95 in 9 games, all starts, pitching 40 innings. Before being called up, he had started the year in AA with the Frisco Rough Riders, then was promoted to the AAA Round Rock Express. In 18 starts between the two stops, he was 8-5, 3.04.\n In 2023, he started the season with the Rangers as a reliever and pitched 17 times, going 2-3, 5.92. He was then sent down to AAA Round Rock on June 15th, and made three starts there with no decisions and an ERA of 2.79. On June 30th, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals along with low-level minor leaguer Roni Cabrera in return for hard-throwing reliever Aroldis Chapman. He soon distinguished himself as the Royals' most reliable starting pitcher and a rare bright spot in a very difficult season. In August, he picked up 53 strikeouts in 36 2/3 innings; before that, his previous high in one month had been 16, and such a jump had not been seen for over one hundred years - more precisely back in 1911 when Grover Cleveland Alexander was emerging as one of baseball's greatest pitchers. This earned him the American League's Pitcher of the Month Award for August after he finished the month at 3-1, 1.72 in his 6 starts, in addition to all the strikeouts. On September 4th, he had another great start, allowing just one hit in six innings to the Chicago White Sox in a 12-1 win, thereby extending his streak of scoreless innings to 21. He pitched five more scoreless innings against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 10th but in the 6th, he walked two batters with two outs, and then slipped while making his first pitch to Alejandro Kirk, the ball going straight to the backstop with the two runners advancing. He seemed to lose his concentration after that as his next two pitches were wild as well, allowing the two runners to score, thus ending his scoreless streak."},

He was both a pitcher and a position player in high school,  and he would have continued as a two-way player had he gone on to college, but the Royals stated they were interested in him strictly as a hitter. The signing scout for the Royals was Rich Amaral. As a youngster, he had been one of the heroes of the Huntington Beach, CA's teams win in the 2011 Little League World Series, stroking the game-winning hit in the finale against Japan. He again stopped Japan in the 2015 U-18 Baseball World Cup. He hit .200/.359/.200 for the tourney and was 2-0 with a 1.26 ERA and 17 K in 14 1/3 IP. He beat Japan in the finale (they had been 8-0 before then). He tied for the tournament lead in wins, was 4th in batters fanned and was named tournament MVP. In both events, he was a teammate of future major leaguer Hagen Danner.\n He made his professional debut the year he was drafted, with the AZL Royals, hitting .247/.330/.414 in 52 games. In 2018, he was promoted to full-season Class A ball with the Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League. He played 127 games and put up solid statistics, hitting .280/.343/.443, with 33 doubles, 14 homers and 62 RBIs. He also showed good speed, stealing 22 bases in 27 attempts. He had entered the year as #2 prospect in the Royals' organization and was a mid-season All-Star in the Sally League, and was also named the \"Top Star\" of the circuit's All-Star Game. He took a big step backwards in 2019, however, as with the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League, he fell to .191/.278/.310 in 124 games. He struck out a whopping 164 times with just 80 hits. Still the team won the league title for the first time since 1999 that season and Pratto was the regular first baseman all year in spite of his sub-par production at the plate.\n Pratto then was forced to sit out the 2020 season due to the shutdown of the minor leagues by the Coronavirus pandemic, but he did get invited to play at the Royals' alternative training site in Omaha, NE. When spring training started in 2021, he was completely overshadowed by teammate SS Bobby Witt Jr., who threatened to break camp with the Royals after impressing everyone, but the two ended up together in AA with the Northwest Arkansas Naturals, forming half of the infield. Both were named to play for the American League at the 2021 Futures Game, and both were promoted to AAA only days after the game, on July 17th. Pratto was hitting .273 with 15 homers and 43 RBIs and while still striking out a lot, had doubled his walk rate in comparison to his disappointing season with Wilmington two years earlier. He was originally named to participate in the 2022 Futures Game, but before that could happen, he got to make his major league debut when he was one of ten players called up by the Royals on July 14, 2022 as a large number of players on the major league roster were unvaccinated and unable to make the trip to Canada as a result. He started that game against the Toronto Blue Jays at first base, batting sixth, and went 0 for 3 with a walk"},

He made his pro debut for the AZL Royals in 2007 and reached the major leagues late in the 2011 season. He did extremely well in his first taste of the big leagues, hitting .331/.361/.473 in 39 games, during which he hit 8 doubles, 2 triples and 3 homers, with 20 runs scored and 21 RBI. He hit his first career homer on August 29th, connecting off the Detroit Tigers' Max Scherzer as part of a three-hit day in a 9-5 Royals win.\n As a result of his good play the previous year, Perez headed into spring training in 2012 as the favorite to be the Royals' starting catcher, but he injured his knee and had to go on the 60-day disabled list before the start of the season. After undergoing surgery, he returned to the majors on June 22nd, smashing a two-run homer off the St. Louis Cardinals' Joe Kelly in his season debut.\n On September 20, 2014, with the Royals trying to make the postseason for the first time since 1985, Salvador made a costly baserunning blunder in a key game against the AL Central-leading Detroit Tigers. With the score tied at 1-1 in the 6th, he was on third base with Eric Hosmer on second with one out when Omar Infante lined out to 2B Ian Kinsler for the second out. Kinsler tried to pick Hosmer off second base, but his throw ended up in left field, allowing Perez to score. The Tigers put on an appeal play, after Hernan Perez, sitting on the bench, told manager Brad Ausmus that the Royals' catcher had failed to retouch third base before scoring. At first, third base umpire Larry Vanover denied the appeal, but Ausmus asked for a video review. Vanover said the play was not reviewable, but still checked with Major League Baseball headquarters in New York, NY. While that was going on, the scoreboard at Kauffman Stadium showed a replay, with Salvador not coming close to retouching the bag; so after MLB confirmed that the play could not be reviewed, the four umpires conferred and decided to reverse the original call, negating Perez's run. It turned out to be a key one as the Tigers scored twice in the top of the 7th and won the game, 3-2. Still the Royals ended up making the postseason, and Perez contributed a .260 batting average with 28 doubles, 17 homers and 70 RBIs. He also played 146 games at catcher, most in the majors, and his excellent defensive play led to a second Gold Glove. In the postseason, he went 1 for 6 with an RBI as the Royals won a epic extra-inning game to eliminate the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Game. He continued to struggle at the plate in the next two series, going a combined 3 for 28 as the Royals went undefeated to reach the 2014 World Series where they met the San Francisco Giants. He was excellent in that seven-game battle, going 8 for 24 (.333) with a double and a homer as the Royals fell just short of the big prize.\n Perez was back at it with another solid all-around season in 2015 as he made the All-Star team and won a Gold Glove both for the third straight year. With the Royals never in danger of missing the postseason and a solid back-up available in Drew Butera (at least on the defensive side), he was able to get a little more rest but still played 139 games behind the plate. Given his large size and instinct for blocking all sorts of ball in the dirt, he got banged up more that his share by foul tips and errant pitches, but still hit .260 with 25 doubles, a career-high 21 homers and 70 RBIs in 142 games. This time, his bat was present all postseason, though: he hit a pair of homers in both the Division against the Houston Astros and the Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. His contributions were essential both times as the series were hard-fought and decided by small margins. In the World Series he became a full-fledged star by winning the World Series Most Valuable Player Award in hitting .364 with a pair of doubles and proving a rock behind the plate in playing all but the very last inning of the Series in which the Royals won their first title in 30 years by defeating the New York Mets in five games.\n Perez signed a contract extension with the Royals as spring training opened in 2016, putting his name on a deal that went for five years at $52.5 million on March 1st. Two days before signing, however, his mother Yilda Diaz was the victim of a carjacking by heavily-armed gunmen in his hometown of Valencia Venezuela. She escaped unarmed, but the attack was a symptom of the risks many Latin players and their families were facing, especially in the deteriorating security climate of Venezuela. On April 19th, he set a personal best with 5 RBIs in an 8-6 win over the Detroit Tigers; the game included a three-run homer off Blaine Hardy. Typically, he had played in all 13 of the Royals' games until then, with 12 of those as the starting catcher. He played 139 games that season and hit .247 with 22 homers and 64 RBIs. He won his fourth Gold Glove and was named the winner of the Silver Slugger Award as the best-hitting catcher in the AL for the first time, while also being an All-Star for the fourth time. However, the Royals fell back in the standings and missed the postseason, and then sank back to the bottom over the next two seasons, 2017 and 2018, as most of the players who had led the team to back-to-back World Series were gone or had seen their production fall significantly. Perez was an exception, as he was an All-Star both years and added both a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger Award the second. In 2017, he hit .268 with 27 homers and 80 RBIs and in 2018 he was at .235, also with 27 homers and 80 RBIs, playing 129 games both years.\n He had clearly settled into a groove by that point, but he was derailed by an injury in the early days of spring training in 2019. He was diagnosed with ligament damage on March 1st and the recommendation was that he undergo Tommy John surgery, meaning that he would miss the entire season, something that was confirmed a few days later. He did miss the season, but when he came back in 2020, he was better than ever, hitting .333 with 11 homers and 32 RBIs in 37 games during the abbreviated season. That earned him the American League Comeback Player of the Year Award in addition to his third Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting catcher in the league. It wasn't all smooth sailing though as he missed the start of resumed training camp because he tested positive for COVID-19, and then another three weeks during the season because of an eye infection. In 2021, he was supposed to play the final year of his contract before becoming a free agent, but on March 21st, he and the Royals agreed on a four-year extension worth $82 million - a franchise record. He was already the franchise leader for games at catcher and the deal made it very likely that he would end up spending his entire career in a Royals uniform.\n Perez picked up in 2021 exactly where he had left off the year before - except that he was healthy all season. As a result, he put up the best numbers of his career, leading to seventh participation in the All-Star Game. He reached the 30-homer mark for the first time of his career on August 15th, but he was just getting started as he added another 8 dingers before the end of the month, including homers in five consecutive games from August 25-29. On September 4th, he added two more to reach the 40 mark. It was just the eighth season in history in which a player had hit 40 homers while primarily playing catcher, with Hall of Famers Johnny Bench and Mike Piazza responsible for two each. Interestingly, Perez was the first to do so in the American League. The season record of 45, set by Bench in 1970, was within reach, as was the Royals' single-season record of 48, set by Jorge Soler in 2019. He also passed long-time teammate Alex Gordon for fourth place on the team's all-time list, with 192. He tied Bench's mark with a homer on September 16th that also put him in a three-way tie for the AL and major league lead with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Shohei Ohtani. On September 21st, he hit #46 against the Cleveland Indians to pass Bench and also to take sole possession of the major league lead. One caveat about his \"record\" was that he had actually hit only 31 of his homers as a catcher, the rest coming as a DH, so he was actually well shy of the record for homers by an actual catcher, which was held by Javy Lopez, who had hit 42 of his 43 homers in 2003 while toiling behind the dish. He tied Soler's team record with his 48th homer on September 29th, which was the total he finished with, tied with Guerrero for the major league lead. One interesting tidbit was that he drew only 28 walks, giving him the second-highest homer-to-walk ratio for anyone hitting 40 or more dingers in a season, at 1.71 to 1. Only Dante Bichette, who had slugged 40 homers while walking only 22 times in 1995 had ever posted a higher ratio. Given the weakness of the rest of the Royals line-up, one would think opposite pitchers would have wanted to pitch around him a bit more. He won his 4th Silver Slugger Award after the season.\n Playing for Venezuela in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, he was named the MVP of Pool C after leading his team to a perfect 4-0 record. On March 30, 2023, he was named the fourth team captain in the history of the Royals. He succeeded George Brett and Frank White who held the title jointly in 1989-1990, with Brett continuing by himself until his retirement at the end of the 1993 season, and Mike Sweeney who was captain from 2003 to 2008."},

That was in spite of having played only the equivalent of two full seasons in the system, after being a mid-level draft pick.\n He was drafted by the Royals in the 11th round of the 2019 amateur draft, out of Old Dominion University and rose quickly through the minor league ranks. In his first pro season, he hit .294/.371/.592 in 57 games for the Burlington Royals of the Appalachian League but then had to sit out the 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic. In 2021, he really emerged after starting the season with the Quad Cities River Bandits of the High-A Central. He hit .291 with 13 homers in 61 games to earn a mid-season promotion to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Double-A Central, where he did even better, batting .310 in 55 games, with 11 homers. Overall, his combined line in 116 games was .300/.394/.563 with 37 doubles, 24 homers, 79 runs scored and 84 runs. That's when he began to show up on top prospect lists, and his strong start with the Omaha Storm Chasers of the AAA International League put him in an even brighter spotlight, as he batted .280 with 18 homers and 67 RBIs in his first 69 games, and even had more walks than strikeouts (37 to 36). He was named the IL Player of the Month for May.\n Fans in Kansas City were clamoring for him to be called up to the big club, which had one of the worst records in the majors by mid-June of 2022. They got their wish when the Royals traded 1B Carlos Santana to the Seattle Mariners on June 27th, clearing a spot on the roster for Vinnie. He was not available to play that day, the trade having come too close to the game, but on June 28th he was in the starting line-up as the DH and number 6 hitter against the Texas Rangers (Hunter Dozier was starting at first base). He went 0-for-4 in his debut, an 8-3 loss. He hit his first homer on July 1st, although he thought at first that he had been thrown out at second base by Detroit Tigers RF Willi Castro, before a video replay confirmed that the ball had indeed cleared the fence before bouncing back on the field where Castro retrieved it. He would have had his first major league hit in either case, but it would have been a lot less glorious to be caught stretching on the milestone play. He hit .295 in 72 games with 10 homers and 26 RBIs as a rookie and was named the DH on the 2022 Topps All-Star Rookie Team.\n Before the 2023 season, he was named to the Italian national team for the 2023 World Baseball Classic. He played 61 games for the Royals, hitting .247 with 9 homers and 26 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 109. However, he played his last game on June 9th due to a torn labrum in his right shoulder that forced him to miss the rest of the year."},

After hitting .314 in 40 games for the DSL Blue Jays in 2014, he moved to the United States in 2015 with the GCL Blue Jays. There he hit just .198 in 38 games. He followed that by playing just 15 games in 2016, for the Bluefield Blue Jays of the Appalachian League, where he improved to .273. After that slow beginning to his career, he jumped to 120 games in 2017, 101 with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League and 19 with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League. He combined for a batting line of .269/.327/.468, with 27 doubles, 10 triples and 17 homers, scoring 93 runs and driving in 72. He also stole 20 bases.\n Having established himself as a legitimate prospect, he was then traded to the San Diego Padres on January 6, 2018 along with P Jared Carkuff in return for IF Yangervis Solarte. He made the Padres' opening day roster in 2020, but hit just .176 in 13 games to be sent down to the team's alternate training site. On August 29th, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals along with a player to be named later (Dylan Coleman) in return for P Trevor Rosenthal. He was still considered a top prospect, but the Padres were in a \"win now\" mode and the outfield was an area where they were stacked and could afford to lose a talented player in order to patch a leaky bullpen. He played 18 games for the Royals, batting .274 with 2 homers and 7 RBIs. In 2021, he spent the bulk of the season in AAA with the Omaha Storm Chasers, now that the minor leagues were back in business, and hit .313 with 15 homers and 36 RBIs in 67 games. In 39 games with KC, he batted .238 with 5 homers and 12 RBIs.\n He seemed ready to become a starter for the first time in 2022 but he was slowed down by a right quad strain which kept him out of action for a month starting on May 9th. It was unfortunate as he had started the season hitting well, with a .371 average after 15 games. He then went back to Omaha for a rehabilitation assignment, and on his return to the big leagues on June 24th, had the first multi-homer game of his career, leading the Royals to a 3-1 win over the Oakland Athletics. He missed two more months from mid-July to mid-September with a bad quad strain. He finished the season hitting .286 in 53 games, with 4 homers and 15 RBIs. His OPS+ of 110 gave the Royals some hope that he could be a productive player - if he managed to stay on the field for a whole season.\n He was healthy at the start of 2023 and starting regularly in left field, although he was not hitting very much. Still, on May 28th, he delivered one of the few highlights of the team's first two months when he hit a tape-measure homer that smashed into the scoreboard at Kauffman Stadium, breaking a bank of lights and leaving smoke pouring out in its wake. The 452-foot blast tied the score at 2-2 against the Washington Nationals in the 8th inning, and K.C. managed to win the game, 3-2, with a run in the 9th."},

For his part, MJ did not attend college, after being drafted out of high school in the 2nd round of the 2017 amateur draft by the Kansas City Royals. He moved from Montgomery, AL to Miami, FL before his senior year of high school as he moved with his father, who was previously employed at Alabama State University prior to taking on the FIU head coaching job before the 2017 season.\n A catcher and a former member of the United States junior national team, he struggled in his third season in the minors, batting just .163 in 110 games for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League in 2019; he struck out a whopping 165 times in 363 at-bats. That came after hitting .251/.322/.492 with 19 homers and 73 RBIs in 111 games for the Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League in 2018, making the circuit's All-Star team. After sitting out the 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic, he bounced back in a big way in 2021 when he led all of the minor leagues with 41 homers, between the AA Northwest Arkansas Naturals and the AAA Omaha Storm Chasers; his batting line was .288/.386/.625 in 124 games, with 22 doubles in addition to the 41 long balls, and 103 RBIs.

Starting at DH against the St. Louis Cardinals that day, he went 1 for 3 with a walk in a 7-1 win. On July 11th, he became the first catcher to serve as the leadoff hitter in Royals history, when he was asked to fill the role in the second game of a twinbill against the Detroit Tigers, with Whit Merrifield sidelined by a toe injury after playing in a franchise record 553 straight games. He did well in the unfamiliar role, as he singled, walked and hit a sacrifice fly - all in the first three innings of a 7-3 win."},

However, by the time he was ready to turn pro, the COVID-19 pandemic had shortened the 2020 amateur draft to just five rounds and he was one of the numerous mid-level college prospects left out in the cold. He thus signed with the Kansas City Royals as an undrafted free agent for a token bonus on June 23, 2020. He was a two-way player in college, but the Royals signed him to be strictly a pitcher. Texas Tech reached the College World Series twice during his time with the school.\n He had to wait until the 2021 season to begin his pro career, pitching in a total of 13 games between the ACL Royals Blue, ACL Royals Gold and Columbia Fireflies, going 0-1, 7.41. Things did not go much better for Columbia in 2022, as he went 1-2, 6.10 in 26 appearances, all in relief, in the Carolina League.

In 2014, he went 8-12, 3.40 in 26 starts between the Palm Beach Cardinals, Springfield Cardinals and Memphis Redbirds, reaching AAA after only a season and a half.\n Mike's quick progression up the ladder was slowed in 2015, as he was limited to 12 starts by thoracic outlet syndrome, and when he did pitch, his ERA was a poor 5.87. He spent time with Springfield and the GCL Cardinals on a rehabilitation assignment that season. He got back on track in 2016, however, as he was 5-2, 2.30 in 9 starts for Springfield, and 3-3, 2.94 in 9 starts for Memphis when he got the call to the Show in late July. In his debut, he started the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 24th, but he was battered around, as he allowed 9 runs on 8 hits in only 1 1/3 innings in a nationally televized Sunday night game. In the 1st inning, before he could retire anyone, he loaded the bases with the first three batters he faced, then Adrian Gonzalez tagged him for a grand slam. He was the first pitcher to start off his career in such an awful manner since Joey McLaughlin had done the same thing for the 1977 Atlanta Braves. Howie Kendrick added a three-run shot the next inning to end his outing prematurely. The bullpen then held the Dodgers scoreless the rest of the way, but the damage had been done as Mayers and the Cards lost, 9-6. He had a 60.75 ERA at the end of the game.\n On May 29, 2023, he had the best game of his career for the Kansas City Royals against his former team, the Cardinals. Josh Staumont started that day's game with a perfect 1st inning as the Royals' opener, then Mayers kept retiring opponents systematically through seven innings, as the two put in a bid for the first combined perfect game in major league history. That ended when the first two batters in the 8th, Nolan Arenado and Willson Contreras, hit back-to-back singles, also ending his outing. However, Taylor Clarke retired the next three batters without a run scoring, and Amir Garrett added a perfect 9th to complete a 7-0 combined shutout, with Mike receiveing credit for the win.

He was signed by scout J.D. Alleva and scouting supervisor Clarence Johns for a $930,000 bonus and made his pro debut that summer.\n In the 2010 Futures Game, Lyles pitched the 6th inning for the USA in a 9-1 win. Relieving Mike Minor, he retired Hak-ju Lee and Yonder Alonso. Pedro Báez pinch-hit for Alex Liddi and singled but Lyles got Carlos Peguero swinging to end the inning. He was relieved by Shelby Miller.\n Lyles was the youngest player in the major leagues when he made his debut for the Houston Astros on May 31, 2011. Pitching against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, he was outstanding, holding the Cubs scoreless through 7 innings, before giving up a pair of baserunners to start the 8th; both of them came to score as the bullpen faltered (one of the runs being unearned) and he stood to be the losing pitcher in spite of his great performance. He had given up only 5 hits, walked none and struck out 4 over the 7 innings. However, his teammates picked him up with a 6-run outburst against Cubs closer Carlos Marmol in the top of the 9th to win the game, 7-3; he ended up with a no-decision. He struggled in his second start on June 5, though, allowing 3 1st-inning runs to San Diego and leaving after 4 innings, being charged with a 7-2 loss. He was in fact winless in his first 11 career starts, an Astros record, before coming out on the right end of the ledger on August 3rd, when he beat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-4, to improve his record to 1-5. He got some support from former minor league teammate J.D. Martinez, who hit his first major league homer and added a two-run double in the game. After he won his second game on August 20th, the Astros announced he would be sent down to AAA to finish the year pitching out of the bullpen, in an effort to limit the number of innings he would pitch that season.\n On August 18, 2012, Lyles was the loser of the last game managed by Brad Mills with the Astros. Lyles gave up 6 runs without recording an out in the 5th inning that day, having earlier given up a run in the 2nd inning. All six batters came in to score in what became a 9-run inning and Lyles was charged with the 12-4 loss, bringing his record to 2-10 on the year. After the game, Mills, hitting coach Mike Barnett and first base coach Bobby Meacham were all fired. Fittingly, he gave new manager Tony DeFrancesco his first win as a major league skipper when he beat the New York Mets, 3-1, in his next start on August 24th. The Astros had lost their first four games under their new manager up to that point. He finished the season at 5-12, 5.09 in 25 starts and 141 1/3 innings. In 2013, the Astros' first season in the American League, he was the team's top winner, although that was only courtesy of a 7-9 record for an awful team that lost a franchise-record 111 games. He made 25 starts in 27 appearances, pitched 141 2/3 innings and had a 5.69 ERA, but none of the Astros' other starters managed to win more than 6 games that year. On December 3rd, he was traded to the Colorado Rockies along with CF Brandon Barnes in return for CF Dexter Fowler and a player to be named later, with no guarantee that he would continue to be a starter in 2014, given his lackluster results up to that point.\n However, Lyles took advantage of some early injuries to land a spot in the Rockies' starting rotation at the beginning of 2014 and once there began to pitch very well. An 8-2 win over the Texas Rangers on May 5th improved his record to 4-0 and he was sporting an excellent 2.62 ERA after 7 starts. He was at 5-1, 3.46 on June 4th when he broke his left hand in the 1st inning when he tried to tag out Martin Prado of the Arizona Diamondbacks at home plate after throwing a wild pitch. He stayed until the 4th before being eventually forced to leave the game. On June 11th, Tyler Matzek made his big league debut as a starter with the Rockies; coincidentally, the two share the same date of birth. On August 28th, he broke up Yusmeiro Petit's major league-record streak of 46 consecutive batters retired when he doubled to left in the 3rd inning of a game against the San Francisco Giants. He then scored on Charlie Blackmon's single, but was charged with his team's 4-1 loss after giving up 3 runs on 4 hits in 6 innings. In 22 starts, he went 7-4, 4.33 while pitching 126 2/3 innings.\n Lyles started the 2015 season slowly, as he was 2-5, 5.14 in his first 10 starts. On May 23rd, he sprained his toe and then aggravated the injury in his next start, on May 31st, when he tried to avoid a ball hit back through the middle, tearing a ligament. He was placed on the disabled list two days later and did not pitch again that season. In 2016, he made just 5 starts in his 40 appearances for Colorado, ending up at 4-5, 5.83 with 1 save. He pitched just 58 23 innings and had almost as many walks (28) as strikeouts (32). He was back with Colorado in 2017, but continued to struggle badly, putting up an ERA of 6.94 in 33 games, his only two decisions being losses. He was released on August 1st and signed with the San Diego Padres, where he was placed in the starting rotation. Results were no better, though, as he went 1-3, 9.39 in his 5 starts.\n Lyles started the 2018 season in the bullpen for San Diego, but on May 10th made his first start after Bryan Mitchell lost his spot due to poor results. On May 15th, he became the latest Padres pitcher to make an unsuccessful bid to throw the first no-hitter in franchise history, as he retired the first 22 batters he faced in a start against the Colorado Rockies. He struck out Carlos Gonzalez to open the top of the 8th, his 10th strikeout on the day, but then allowed a single to Trevor Story to break up the attempt. He was replaced by [Kirby Yates]] after following with a walk to Pat Valaika and received credit for the 4-0 win. He went 2-4, 4.29 in 24 games with the Padres, with 8 starts. On August 5h, he was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers and spent the remainder of the season in their bullpen, making 11 appearances and going 1-0, 3.31. He was left off the postseason roster however.\n In 2019, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a free agent. In 17 starts, he went 5-7, 5.36, although his K/W ratio of 90/33 in 82 1/3 innings was quite solid. He had started strong (4-1, 1.97) then faded badly (1-6, 9.57), dropping his last six decisions for the Bucs. On July 29th, the Brewers acquired him for the second straight year, this time giving up minor leaguer Cody Ponce in return for his services. He gave the Brewers an immediate boost, as on July 31st, he defeated the Oakland Athletics, 4-2, allowing just 3 hits in 5 innings. He went 7-1, 2.45 in 11 starts for the Brewers to finish with a combined record of 12-8, 4.15, setting a personal best for wins; his 141 innings were also just two outs short of his total in 2013. However, he did not get to pitch in the postseason as the Brewers lost the Wild Card Game to the Washington Nationals, who would go on to win the 2019 World Series.\n He signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers before the 2020 season, which ended up being cut to just 60 games by the COVID-19 pandemic. He made just 12 appearances that year, 9 of them starts, and ended up with a disappointing record of 1-6, 7.02. The 45 earned runs he allowed were the most by any pitcher in the American League that year. In 2021, he improved somewhat for a rangers team starved for pitching, going 10-13, 5.15 in 32 games, 30 of them starts. He set a new personal innings record with 180 and once again was a league leader in some negative categories, in this case earned runs allowed once again (103) and home runs allowed (38). After the season, he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and had one of his best seasons in 2022 for a much-improved Orioles team, finishing at 12-11, 4.42 in 32 games. He served as a veteran leader on a young pitching staff and turned the solid performance into a contract with the Kansas City Royals for 2023. However, things fell completely apart for him as the Royals lost each of his first 15 starts that year, the longest such streak to start a season in major league history. On June 20th, his record stood at 0-11, 6.72, he was leading the AL in losses, and the Royals had the second worst record in the majors, percentage points ahead of the Oakland Athletics. He finally won a game on June 24th, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays, 9-4, in his 16th start of the season."},

Exceptionally, the game was played at TD Ameritrade Park Omaha in anticipation of the 2019 College World Series, the first major league game ever to be played in Nebraska. He was quite familiar with the ballpark, as this is where Creighton University, from which he graduated, plays its home games, and he had in fact hit a homer there in his final at-bat for the college. In his rookie season, he played 103 games as the Royals' main second baseman and sometimes shortstop, hitting .240 with 2 homers and 30 RBIs. His OPS+ was 58, brought down by an anemic OBP of just .276.\n During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he played in 56 of the Royals' 60 games in spite of hitting just .201 with 1 homer and 13 RBIs, his OPS+ falling to 51. This could have ended his budding career, but moving to shortstop in 2021, he had a much better season, batting .300 with an OBP of .365, 78 runs and 43 RBIs in 151 games. He still did not have any power - he hit just 2 homers - but was also successful on 22 of 23 stolen base attempts and posted an OPS+ of 104. That would be a high-water mark however. In 2022, he fell back to .227 in 141 games as he moved back to second base with the promotion of top prospect Bobby Witt Jr. to play shortstop for the major league club. He did not hit any long balls that year, drove in just 20 runs and scored 51, for an OPS+ of 59. Both that season and in 2021, he led the American League in sacrifice hits, with 12 and 10 respectively, another sign that he was an outlier in the modern game.\n He played for the Italian national team at the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Starting at short, he hit .474/.524/.632 with 7 RBI in 5 games for them. He led the team in hits (2 more than Dominic Fletcher, Sal Frelick and Brett Sullivan), RBI (3 ahead of Fletcher and Frelick), average, slugging (tied with Fletcher) and OPS. He tied for 6th in the WBC in hits (9) and tied for 6th in RBI with Mike Trout, Kazuma Okamoto and Rixon Wingrove even though Trout and Okamoto each played two games due to their team advancing further. He was not the All-Star shortstop as Trea Turner hit even better. He then began the 2023 season as the starting second baseman with the Royals, but hit just .213 in 68 games, although his walk rate improved significantly (his OBP was .323 in spite of a low batting average). His OPS+ was therefore a lot better than the previous year at 70, although this was still well below average. On July 30th, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Taylor Hearn, a pitcher who had just been designated for assignment and would otherwise had been released. It was a sign that he was seen to have little or no value. The Braves were looking at him strictly as a defensive replacement, with their middle infield well in place, but he surprised with his bat in his first couple of starts. On August 12th, in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Mets, he went 4 for 6 with a homer and 5 RBIs and even finished the game on the mound, pitching a scoreless inning in a 21-3 beatdown. On August 14th against the New York Yankees, he was 3 for 4 with another 3 RBIs in an 11-3 win. He was the first player to have 7 hits and 8 RBIs in his first two games for a team."},

The pick was compensation for the Milwaukee Brewers signing Lorenzo Cain, and the Royals also had the next pick in the draft, selecting P Daniel Lynch. Kowar had been drafted previously in 2015, by the Detroit Tigers, but only in the 40th round as he had a strong commitment to attend the University of Florida. He had a very good three years with the Gators, going a combined 25-6 and playing in the College World Series in 2017 and 2018.\n As a professional, he began his career with the Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League in 2018, making 9 starts but pitching just 26 1/3 innings. In 2019, he started the year with the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League, before a mid-season promotion to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Texas League. His combined record was 7-10, 3.52 with 144 strikeouts in 148 1/3 innings; he was a mid-season All-Star with Wilmington. He then was forced to sit out the 2020 season as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the minor leagues. He did spend the year at the Royals' alternate training site, so it was not a complete loss.\n He made his major league debut on June 7, 2021, as the Royals' starting pitcher in an 8-3 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. He did not make it out of the 1st inning, allowing 4 runs on 3 hits and 2 walks while uncorking 3 wild pitches, and he was charged with the loss. It had been 15 years since a pitcher threw three wild pitches in their MLB pitching debut, when Chris Mabeus had done it. The only other time it had happened in under one inning was when position player Jimmy McAleer pitched a game in 1901. His poor maiden outing was a sign of things to come as he went 0-6, 11.27 in 9 games, 8 of them starts, logging just 30 1/3 innings, during which he allowed 43 hits and 20 walks while striking out 29 opponents.\n Jackson's next two seasons with the Royals were not any more convincing. In 2022, pitching exclusively out of the bullpen, he had no decisions in 7 outings but a 9.77 ERA as he allowed 27 hits and 11 walks in 15 2/3 innings. In 2023, he made 23 appearances as a reliever, with a 2-0 record but an ERA of 6.43. Wildness continued to plague him, as he allowed 20 walks in 28 innings. He also spent time in the minors during those two seasons, with the Omaha Storm Chasers of the International League, but things were just as bad at the lower level: he went 4-10, 6.16 in 2022 and 2-5, 5.96 in 2023. At that point, the Royals gave up on him and jumped at the opportunity to trade him for a potentially valuable return: on November 17, 2023, he was sent to the Atlanta Braves in return for Kyle Wright, only one-year removed from a 20-win season in the majors. Wright, himself a first-round pick back in the day, had also struggled badly at times, including in 2023, and was expected to miss all of 2024 after undergoing shoulder surgery, but at least had found some success in the big leagues, something that could not be said of Kowar. He only stayed a Brave for a less than a month, and did not even get a chance to put on the uniform, as on December 3rd, he was traded again, headed this time to the Seattle Mariners as part of a five-player deal. The M's had sent Atlanta OF Jarred Kelenic along with two bad contracts in P Marco Gonzales and 1B Evan White, for a meagre return in Kowar and fellow pitching prospect Cole Phillips. At least, Seattle had a history of success in developing young pitchers, so perhaps thwy would be the ones able to nurture Kowar's undeniable underlying talent."},

They said his \"pitchability is unmatched by any minor leaguer.\"  \n Greinke spent the bulk of the 2004 campaign with the Royals. He allowed two runs over five innings in his debut on May 22nd.  He finished the season with an 8-11 record, a 3.97 ERA, and a 1.17 WHIP.  2005 was not nearly as successful for the young pitcher.  The Royals continued to flounder in the standings, and Greinke's confidence wavered. Despite a strong month of April, the 21 year old finished the first half with a 1-11 record and a 6.20 ERA.  His record for the season was 5-17 and he led the 2005 AL in losses.  One bright spot was Greinke hitting a home run in only his third major league at-bat.\n 2006 brought a strange twist to Greinke's career. His attitude changed in Spring Training, and he suffered a mental breakdown while throwing a bullpen session.  Greinke announced he was leaving the team. He spent much of the season seeking help for depression and anxiety.  He was able to return to baseball later in the season, and even made three relief appearances for the Royals.  \n In 2007, the embattled pitcher returned to spring training, this time hungry for a spot in the starting rotation.  He won a spot, and pitched well in his first two regular season starts: giving up just two runs in 13 innings while fanning 12. The Royals moved Greinke back to the bullpen in May, and he stayed there until late September. On September 20, Greinke pitched eight strong inning against the Chicago White Sox. He yielded two hits, no runs, no walks, and struck out 10. In 52 games, the 23 year old's record was 7-7, and his ERA was 3.69. In 2008, he was back full time in the starting rotation and had a solid year, going 13-10, 3.47 in 32 starts for a team that finished tied for last in the AL Central.\n Greinke was amazing to start 2009, going 8-1 with a 0.84 ERA. He became the first pitcher in 43 years, since Juan Marichal, to have an ERA under 1 after 10 starts, and while he slowed down after that, he continued to rank among the best pitchers in all of baseball for the remainder of the year. He made the All-Star team for the first time and led the American League in ERA and WHIP, finished second in strikeouts, and managed to post a 16-8 record with a dreadful Royals team that gave him very little run support. He was rewarded for his outstanding season by winning the 2009 American League Cy Young Award in a landslide over Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners.\n In December 2010, Greinke was traded with Yuniesky Betancourt and cash to the Milwaukee Brewers for four prospects, Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He had a very solid first year for Milwaukee in 2011, going 16-6 with a 3.83 ERA in 28 starts, striking out 201 batters in only 171 2/3 innings as the Brewers won their first division title since moving to the National League in 1998. He was particularly effective at Miller Park, going 11-0, 3.13 while pitching at home. He showed some signs of fatigue in the postseason, however. In Game 2 of the NLDS, he gave up 4 runs in 5 innings to the Arizona Diamondbacks but ended up with a no-decision as the Brewers won, 9-5. He was credited with a win in Game 1 of the 2011 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, but it was the epitomy of \"winning ugly\": he gave up 6 runs on 8 hits in 6 innings, but won, 9-6. Then in Game 5, he gave up 5 runs in 5 2/3 innings, and this time his teammates' bats failed to bail him out, sticking him with a 7-1 loss.\n Greinke started three consecutive games for the Brewers around the 2012 All-Star Game. Making his regularly-scheduled start on July 7th, he was ejected after making only four pitches for spiking a ball into the ground; he started the next day's game, and lasted only three innings. After the break, he started the Brewers' first game of the second half on July 13th, becoming the first player since Red Faber in 1917 to be his team's starter for three consecutive games. The Brewers quickly regretted that stunt, however, as he was sat down and rested for an additional period before his next start, with manager Ron Roenicke admitting that he may have pushed his ace to do too much. That came at a time when the Brewers were in talks with Greinke about a contract extension, with rumors growing that he would be traded if one was not agreed on before the trading deadline at the end of July. His record was a very solid 9-3, 3.57 in a league-leading 20 starts at the time.  On July 27th, Greinke was indeed traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for three prospects - Jean Segura, John Hellweg and Ariel Pena.\n In his first start for the Angels on July 29, 2012, Zack threw seven innings against the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up 2 runs on 7 hits wihile striking out 8. Unfortunately for him, his opponent on the mound, Jeremy Hellickson, pitched even better and he was charged with the 2-0 loss. On September 25th, he tied a modern major league record by striking out 13 opponents in 5 innings in a start against the Seattle Mariners. During his stint on the mound, he struck out four batters in the 4th inning. Three relievers added seven more Ks to his total, to tie the record for most strikeouts by one team in a nine-inning game. He finished the season with a 6-2 record for the Angels, for a combined 15-5, 3.48 in 34 starts, having pitched 212 1/3 innings and struck out an even 200 batters.\n On December 8, 2012, Greinke signed a six-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, worth $147 million. He had been one of the most sought-after free agents of the off-season. However, he soon gave the Dodgers a scare, experiencing inflammation in his right elbow in spring training in March 2013. He only pitched 13 innings during the spring, and was thus on a strict pitch count when he made his Dodgers debut on April 5th, starting at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, he displayed his best form, allowing three hits and no walks while striking out 6 in 6 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won, 3-0. He was doing well again in his second start, facing the San Diego Padres on April 11th, having only given up a run in 5 innings, when he plunked Carlos Quentin on the left shoulder leading off the 6th. Quentin was enraged, charged the mound and tackled Greinke to the ground, after which the two ended up at the bottom of a huge pile of players from both dugouts. Greinke had turned his left shoulder towards Quentin to break the impact of his charge, but suffered a broken collarbone in the process. He had to leave the game and the following day, it was announced that he would require surgery and miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned much more quickly than anyone anticipated, making his return on May 15th in a start against the Washington Nationals, only a month after his injury. He gave up only a run in 5 1/3 innings that day - the result of a solo homer by Adam LaRoche - and drove in a run himself to earn the 3-1 win. On June 6th, he pitched seven scoreless innings of four-hit ball against the Atlanta Braves for his third win, although rookie Yasiel Puig stole the headlines by hitting a grand slam in continuing his storybook first week in the Show. He was in the middle of things when Puig was hit in the head by a pitch on June 11th against the Arizona Diamondbacks; he threw at Miguel Montero who led off the next inning for Arizona, then was the target of a similar pitch from Ian Kennedy in the bottom of the inning. Benches emptied on both occasions, and punches were thrown on the second. He was not involved in the decision, however, in spite of giving up only 2 runs on 2 hits in 7 innings, as the Dodgers scored some late runs to win, 5-3. He did however soon begin to rack up the wins, and on August 10th registered win number 10 with a 5-0 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. In his next start on August 16th, he pitched 7 1/3 scoreless innings against the Philadelphia Phillies to spoil Ryne Sandberg's managerial debut. He was named the National League's Pitcher of the Month for August, succeeding teammate Clayton Kershaw who had won the honor in July, after going 5-0, 1.23 during the month. He finished the season at 15-4, 2.63, his .789 winning percentage being the best in the NL. Because of the time missed, he pitched only 177 2/3 innings, but still collected 148 strikeouts. He was also fearsome with the bat, leading all major league pitchers with at least 10 at-bats with a .328 average and an OBP of .409; his .379 slugging percentage was second only to Travis Wood, who was at .381. He won the NL Silver Slugger Award as the circuit's best-hitting pitcher as a result. He lost his only start of the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, even though he gave up only a pair of runs in 6 innings, but then went 1-0, 2.40 in two starts in the NLCS, where he was the Dodgers' most effective pitcher in their loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.\n Greinke gave the Dodgers a scare just as Cactus League games began in 2014: he made only four pitches in his first start on February 27th before leaving the game with a right calf strain. In spite of health concerns that made Zack miss the team's season-opening series in Australia, he had a great month of April, going 5-0, 2.04. He concluded the month by recording the 10,000th win in Dodgers history in defeating the Minnesota Twins, 6-4, on April 30th. When he held the San Francisco Giants to 2 runs over 7 innings to improve to 6-1 in a 6-2 win on May 10th, it marked the 20th straight start in which he had allowed 2 runs or less. He eventually pushed the record to 22 straight starts before giving up 3 earned runs on May 27th. On July 25th, he became only the third pitcher in major league history to record a four-strikeout inning for the second time, when he did so in the 3rd inning of an 8-1 win over the Giants. His victims were Hector Sanchez, Tim Lincecum, Hunter Pence, who reached first on a dropped third strike by A.J. Ellis, and Gregor Blanco. He had another great game against the Giants on September 13th, pitching 6 scoreless innings while hitting a double and a homer in a 17-0 win at AT&T Park to win his 15th of the year. He finished the season at 17-8, 2.71, and while he was outshined by teammate Kershaw in awards voting, it made him a solid number 2 starter on the division-winning squad. He made one start in the postseason, in Game 2 of the NLDS facing the St. Louis Cardinals on October 4th, holding them scoreless on 2 hits over 7 innings. He left with a 2-0 lead, but the Cardinals tied it against reliever J.P. Howell and his team's 3-2 win was credited to Brandon League.\n In 2015, the roles were reversed between him and Kershaw in the first half, as he was the team's ace, going into the All-Star Game with a 35 2/3 innings scoreless streak, and ending the first half with a brilliant performance that saw him allow only one hit over 8 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 9th. The 6-0 win improved his record to 8-2, while his ERA was down to 1.39, best in the majors at that point. He was then named to start the All-Star Game and ironically gave up a homer to the first batter he faced, Mike Trout, before settling down and not allowing anything else in two innings. In his first start after the break, on July 19th, he tossed 8 scoreless innings in a 5-0 win against the Washington Nationals to bring his streak to 43 2/3 innings, the longest in the majors since Orel Hershiser's record-setting streak of 59 scoreless innings in 1988, also with the Dodgers. He put the streak on hold for a few days because of bigger priorities, though, as his wife Emily was expecting the couple's first child, and he took a leave of absence from the team on July 23rd to be with her. His son was born that day and Greinke was back on the mound on July 26th, facing the New York Mets. He extended the scoreless streak to 45 2/3 innings before giving up an unearned run in the 3rd when his opponent, Jacob deGrom, drove in Kirk Nieuwenhuis on a fielder's choice; he gave up another run later in the game, but ended up with a no-decision when the Dodgers rallied to tie the game with two runs against Mets closer Jeurys Familia in the 9th. By beating the San Diego Padres, 2-1, on October 3rd, he finished at 19-3 with a 1.66 ERA, the best in the National League that season, ahead of Jake Arrieta's 1.77 and the lowest by any pitcher to qualify for the title since Greg Maddux's 1.63 in 1995. The last Dodgers pitcher with a lower ERA had been Rube Marquard with a 1.58 mark in 1916. He made a pair of starts against the Mets in the Division Series, winning Game 2 but losing Game 5 against Jacob deGrom.\n On November 4, 2015, Greinke announced that he was opting out of the final three years of his contract, which included a guaranteed salary of $71 million, in order to test the free agent market once again. He hit the jackpot again on December 4th, when the Arizona Diamondbacks agreed to shell out $206 million over six years to obtain his services. His average annual salary of $34.3 million made him the highest-paid player in the game at that point. However, in his debut in a D-Backs uniform on opening day on April 4th, he had one of the worst starts of his career. After a couple of scoreless innings against the Colorado Rockies, he gave up six runs in the 3rd, including homers by Trevor Story and Carlos Gonzalez, and then gave up another long ball to Story, who was making his major league debut, the next inning. the 7 runs were the most he had given up in a game since 2012, and the three homers the most since 2009. He was slightly better in his second start on April 9th - but still not good, as he gave up 4 runs to the Chicago Cubs in 6 innings, three of them in the 1st inning, and lost the game, 4-2. He soon righted the ship however, as his next two outings were solid ones, including his first win of the year on April 20th when he outduelled Madison Bumgarner of the Giants to earn credit for a 2-1 victory. After 17 starts, he was 10-3 with a 3.62 ERA when he was placed on the disabled list on July 3rd with a left oblique strain. At first, his absence was expected to be short, but by the last third of July, the D-Backs were being more cautious and did not want to give a return date. His return finally came on August 9th, by which time the D-Backs had pretty much given up any remaining hope of making the postseason. He did win in his return, defeating the Mets, 5-3 for his 8th straight win. On September 5th, he had one of the worst outings of his career against his former team, the Dodgers as he was shelled for five home runs in a 10-2 loss in his first start at Dodger Stadium since changing teams. he finished the season at 13-7, 4.37 in 26 starts.\n Greinke bounced back with a very solid year in 2017, helping to lead the D-Backs back into the postseason. He went 17-7, 3.20 in 32 starts, struck out 215 batters in 202 1/3 innings, returned to the All-Star Game and won his fourth straight Gold Glove. He started the Wild Card Game against the Colorado Rockies on October 4th  but did not make it to the end of the 4th inning, being lifted after allowing 4 runs on 6 hits. Arizona still won the game and moved on to the Division Series, but again, his start in Game 3 against the Dodgers was underwhelming as he gave up 3 runs in 5 innings and was charged with the 3-1 loss that ended the D-Backs' season. In 2018, he had another strong first half that brought him his fifth All-Star nod, then was named the NL's Pitcher of the Month for July after posting a 1.60 ERA and a 35/5 K/W ratio in 5 starts as Arizona fought for first place in the division. However, Arizona collapsed down the stretch and missed the postseason entirely, while he finished with a record of 15-11, 3.21 in 33 starts. He struck 199 batters in 207 2/3 innings.\n He was the D-Backs' Opening Day starter in 2019 but was knocked around by the Dodgers on March 28th, giving up 7 runs in less than 4 innings. However, he came back strong in his next start on April 2nd against the San Diego Padres. Not only did he give up just 3 runs in 6 innings while striking out 10, but he also contributed with the bat, slugging a pair of homers in an 8-5 win. He was only the second pitcher in team history to hit two homers in a game, after Micah Owings. At the end of July, he was 10-4, 2.90 in 23 starts, having been named to the All-Star team for the 6th time earlier in the month. With the Diamondbacks out of contention for the postseason, he became a valuable trade chip in spite of his large contract and Arizona extracted maximum value in return, obtaining the three top prospects of the Houston Astros - Seth Beer, J.B. Bukauskas and Corbin Martin - and another minor leaguer, Josh Rojas, in return. He suddenly joined a formidable starting rotation that already included Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole and Wade Miley. He was a winner in his first start for his new team on August 6th, defeating the Rockies, 11-6. On August 18th, he recorded the 200th win of his career when he defeated the Oakland Athletics, 4-1. He went 8-1, 3.02 in 10 starts for the Astros to finish the year at 18-5, 2.93. He saw heavy use in the postseason, starting five games as the Astros made it to Game 7 of the World Series before losing to the Washington Nationals; he went 0-2 and pitched 25 innings. \n In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he made just 12 starts and went 3-3, 4.03 while pitching 67 innings. The Astros again went deep in the postseason, reaching the final game of the ALCS, but this time he made just 3 starts - one in each series - going 1-0 with a win over the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 4 of the ALCS, when the Astros were facing elimination. In 2021, he went 11-6 as the Astros ran away with a division title in the AL West, although his ERA of 4.16 was among the highest of the team's main pitchers. This explains why he was relegated to a secondary role in the postseason, only pitching 2 1/3 innings over the first two rounds. Still, he was tabbed to start Game 4 of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves, because ace Lance McCullers was unavailable. One interesting fact in that game, on October 30th, was that he batted 8th, only the second pitcher in World Series history to bat in a spot other than 9th: the other had been Babe Ruth, who batted 6th in his start for the Boston Red Sox in the 1918 World Series. This was motivated by the fact that catcher Martin Maldonado was almost incapable of getting a hit during the postseason. He ended up getting a hit in that game, and another one as a pinch-hitter in Game 5. With the National League adopting the designated hitter before the 2022 season, this was likely to make him the last pitcher in history to get a hit - barring unusual future circumstances.\n A free agent after the 2021 World Series, he returned to his original team, the Kansas City Royals when he signed a one-year deal with them on March 16, 2022. His base salary was $13 million, with a possible additional $2 million in performance bonuses. He was selected as his team's Opening Day starter, making him the oldest pitcher in team history to receive the honor. He seemed to defy all logic in his first few outings of the season, putting up a 2.57 ERA over 28 innings in his first 5 starts - in spite of striking out just 7 batters over that span. The key was that he wasn't walking anyone - just 3 - and not allowing many hits either - 24, with just 2 homers. He seemed to defy the rule that no one could survive in today's game with such a low strikeout rate. One thing he couldn't control, however, was his run support, as he was 0-2, having benefitted from just 8 runs from his teammates over the five starts, including being shut out twice, these two 1-0 games accounting for both of his losses. On May 30th, he went on the injured list with a right flexor strain and missed a month of action. His return on June 24th was a good one though as he won his first game as a Royal since September 30, 2010, 3-1 over the Oakland Athletics. In that game, he gave up 1 runs on 3 hits and no walks in 6 innings to improve his record to 1-4. On June 30th, he earned another win in what was the milestone 500th start of his career, 2-1 over the Texas Rangers. He was only the 48th player in major league history to make that many starts. He finished the season at 4-9, 3.68 in 26 starts and 137 innings, for an ERA+ of 111.\n On February 4, 2023, he re-signed with the Royals for another season, explaining that he was having a lot of fun playing for his original team and would not want to play anywhere else at this stage of his career. For their part, the Royals appreciated the experience he brought to what was a very young pitching staff. On May 13th, he became the fifth pitcher in major league history to have struck out 1,000 different batters in his career after ringing up Brice Turang and Joey Wiemer of the Milwaukee Brewers in the 5th inning of a 4-3 Royals loss. The four men who had preceded him were Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Roger Clemens - the very definition of elite company. With 2,914 career strikeouts, he had the lowest total of the four by far but had a very good shot at reaching the mythic 3,000 strikeouts mark by the end of the season."},

He was a 22nd-round selection by the Cincinnati Reds in the 2011 amateur draft; the scout was Clark Crist. He signed up for almost $1 million with a clause that he could play college basketball. As a college freshman, he averaged 7.4 points per game and 4 rebounds per game for St. John's University. He started off his pro baseball career the next season with the AZL Reds. He was then promoted to the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League at then end of the season, finishing the year at 0-2, 4.05. He fell to 5.4 points per game in basketball as a college sophomore. \n In 2013, he made 13 starts between Billings and the Dayton Dragons of the Midwest League, with a record of 2-4, 5.15. He transferred to Cal State-Northridge for basketball, as the team was coached by former NBA star Reggie Theus, and sat out the 2013-14 year. He began to emerge from the pack in baseball in 2014, when he was 7-8, 3.64 in a full season at Dayton, striking out 127 batters in 133 1/3 innings. He tied Mitch Brown for 7th in the Reds chain in whiffs. He decided to quit basketball to focus on baseball. Baseball America named him the #11 prospect in the Midwest League, between Buck Farmer and Jesmuel Valentin. They also named him the #7 Reds prospect and the best athlete in the Reds chain. \n In 2015, the big lefthander moved up to the Daytona Tortugas of the Florida State League and went 9-7, 2.44 in 26 starts. He lost the FSL ERA title by .03 to Pablo Ortega, tied for 5th in wins and was second in whiffs, 10 K behind Kevin Ziomek. He allowed only one hit and fanned 12 in 7 shutout innings in the postseason, walking none. He was FSL Co-Pitcher of the Year with Jacob Faria. He also won the Reds Minor League Pitcher of the Year award. He began to make top prospect lists and was named to the USA squad for the 2015 Futures Game. In the top of the 3rd, he relieved Lucas Giolito with a scoreless game in progress. He fanned Manuel Margot and got Nomar Mazara on a grounder. Raimel Tapia singled, advanced on a passed ball by Kyle Schwarber and scored on a hit by Ketel Marte. Ozhaino Albies singled, but LF Michael Conforto threw out Marte at home. After the US scored 3 in the bottom of the inning, Tyler Beede relieved Garrett. Though he gave up their only run in a 10-1 win, the bottom-of-the-3rd rally made a winner of Garrett. Baseball America placed him as the FSL's #6 prospect (between Jeff Hoffman and Amed Rosario) and as #3 in the Reds system (behind fellow hurlers Robert Stephenson and Cody Reed).\n In 2016, he began the year in AA with the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Southern League and was dominant, with a 5-3, record and a 1.75 ERA in 13 games. At the end of May, he was promoted to the AAA Louisville Bats, then was named to take part in the 2016 Futures Game. He was 7-8, 2.55 in 25 games (23 starts), having finished the season in AAA with the Louisville Bats. Hes struck out 132 batters in 144 2/3 innings. He was 4th in the Reds chain in whiffs, between Tyler Mahle and Jackson Stephens. Baseball America rated him as the #73 prospect in all of baseball, 11th in the SL (between Anthony Banda and Dustin Peterson) and 16th in the International League (between Jose Berrios and Jose Peraza). \n He was a winner in his major league debut for the Reds on April 7, 2017. Facing the St. Louis Cardinals, he gave up only 2 hits and no runs in 6 innings to receive credit for a 2-0 win. He did it again in his next start on April 12th, with 6 2/3 scoreless innings in a 9-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He slowed down after that fast start, however, ending up at 3-8, 7.39 in 16 games, including 14 starts. He was returned to the minor leagues for a spell. He was then converted to a full-time relief pitcher in 2018 and had considerably more success, going 1-2, 4.29 in 66 games. He pitched 63 innings and struck out 75 batters while allowing just 56 hits as a set-up man for closer Raisel Iglesias, recording 21 holds in 23 opportunities. He had an even better season in 2019, making 69 appearances and pitching 56 innings. He went 5-3 with an ERA of 3.21, allowed 44 hits and struck out 78 opponents. He did allow 35 walks, for his highest career walk rate, and had another 22 holds, confirming his role as a key member of the team's bullpen. He followed that with a good performance during the abbreviated 2020 seasion when he pitched 20 times in relief, with an ERA of 2.45 over 18 1/3 innings. His only decision was a win and he struck out 26 batters against 7 walks. The reds made it into the expanded postseason and he pitched once against the Atlanta Braves in the Wild Card Series, when he gave up the game-winning hit to the only batter he faced, Freddie Freeman, in the bottom of the 13th inning of Game 1 on September 30th, breaking what had been a scoreless tie. The loss went to Archie Bradley, who had put two men in scoring position before turning the ball over to Amir, who was not able to extricate himself from that jam.\n He had a down year in 2021, after the Reds had tabbed him to replace Iglesias as the team's closer. He did save a career-high 7 games but also collected 4 blown saves and his numbers were poor across the board as he went 0-4, 6.04 in 63 games, allowing 46 hits in 47 2/3 innings in addition to 29 walks while striking out 61. Before the start of the 2022 season, on March 16th, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals in return for veteran starter Mike Minor in the hope that a change of scenery would do him good."},

It took a long and convoluted road to get him there however.\n He was born in the Dominican Republic but grew up in Brooklyn, NY. Upon graduating from high school, he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 40th round of the 2012 amateur draft, but decided to go on to college at the University of Maryland. He was an infielder at the time and that was the only position he played in his three seasons in college. He struggled as a freshman, batting below .200 with 1 homer, but improved each of his next two years when he led his school in homers both years. That led to his being drafted again, this time in the 11th round, by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2015 amateur draft.\n He began his playing career in 2015 with the Helena Brewers of the Pioneer League and in 2016 was promoted to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League, for whom he was the starting third baseman while also playing other infield positions. He looked to be a solid prospect, but his bat went cold that year, as he hit .170/.263/.240 in 120 games. Strong defensive play could not rescue that disaster, and in 2017, he was demoted to the Low-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League before returning to High-A with the Carolina Mudcats. However, he failed to reach the Mendoza Line at either stop and was relegated to being a utility infielder as the Brewers became convinced he was never going to hit enough to progress further. He was still an excellent athlete, however, so they decided to give him a look as a pitcher in 2018.\n His first season on the mound was not a great success, as he went 2-0 but with an ERA of 8.38 in 13 games with Wisconsin, being released on July 10th. However, he then signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League, and began to work on throwing sidearm at the urging of pitching coach Francisco Rodriguez, the former All-Star closer. He was 2-1, 2.38 in 22 games the rest of the way, then started off 2019 by putting up an ERA of 0.71 in his first 10 games, which prompted the Arizona Diamondbacks to sign him on May 25th for a second go-round in Organized Baseball. He appeared with three different teams that year, the Hillsboro Hops, Kane County Cougars and Visalia Rawhide, with good results. Together, he was 6-3, 1.60 with 10 saves in 26 games, with 30 hits allowed in 45 innings. He pitched in the Dominican League after the season, but appeared in only one game - and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. A number of teams decided to trim their minor league rosters when it became clear that there would be no games that season, and marginal players like José - even those coming off a promising season - were the ones who got the axe. He was released on May 22nd and his career appeared to be over.\n He went to work for Federal Express to make ends meet and feed his young family, but his brother Alex, himself a former college player, convinced him not to give up on his dreams of making it in baseball. He continued to work out with Alex in his spare time and managed to find work again in the Dominican League that winter. He did not give up a single run in 6 outings for the Aguilas Cibaenas, and after he went back to Long Island and again started the year with a string of scoreless innings (11 in 5 games), it convinced the Kansas City Royals to give him another look. It was coach Tony Pena Jr., who had seen him pitch in the Dominican League, who convinced the organization to give him a shot. So he signed with his third organization on June 17th and appeared in the Arizona League as well as AA and AAA, doing very well with the Northwest Arkansas Naturals and capping his season with 5 scoreless innings for the Omaha Storm Chasers. Overall, he was 5-1, 1.51 in 27 games between the three stops. After another successful campaign with the Aguilas Cibaenas that winter, he was back in Omaha to start 2022. He continued be nearly unhittable, going 0-3, 1.74 with 3 saves in his first 20 outings to earn the call to K.C. In his debut, he struck out the first batter he faced, Oscar Mercado after a long battle, then induced a pair of ground balls - his specialty - to complete a flawless debut. Following the season, he was named the recipient of the Tony Conigliaro Award that recognized players who have overcome important obstacles - in his case his very convoluted route to the Show.\n In his rookie season with the Royals in 2022, he pitched 47 times out of the bullpen, finishing at 4-2, 3.58 with 1 save. In 37 2/3 innings, he struck out 34 batters and gave up 24 walks. In 2023, he was back in a similar role, although facing a few more batters per appearance as he logged 41 2/3 innings in 45 games pitched over the first four months. He was 3-0, 4.54 during that span when he was traded to the Chicago Cubs on July 31st in return for OF Nelson Velazquez."},

He shares the record, with Jordan Hicks, for highest recorded mph on his heater, cranking it to 105.1 mph.  A Cuban defector, he was perhaps the top relief ace of the 2010s, holding the MLB record for most consecutive relief appearances with a strikeout (49). \n Chapman's paternal grandfather came to Cuba from Jamaica.  By and large, Afro-Cubans with English surnames are of Jamaican descent.  Aroldis debuted with Holguín in the 2005-2006 Serie Nacional, going 3-5 with a 4.33 ERA.  He played for Cuba in the 2006 World Junior Championship, then put on an excellent show in the 2006-2007 Serie Nacional with a 4-3 record, 7 saves and a 2.77 ERA.  More impressively, he struck out 100 and allowed just 59 hits in 81 1/3 innings.  He led the league in strikeouts, five ahead of runner-up Adiel Palma, though he also ranked 6th in walks (50).  In the 2007 Pan American Games, he pitched one scoreless inning, striking out two for the Gold Medalists.  He was a star in the 2007 Baseball World Cup, in which Cuba won Silver, fanning 9 in 7 innings in a win over South Korea and whiffing 11 while allowing only 3 hits and a run in eight innings in the semifinal win over the Japanese national team.  He was named to the tournament All-Star team as the top left-handed pitcher.  Chapman's success in international events did not carry over for the 2007-2008 Serie Nacional. He was 6-7 with a 3.89 ERA despite a .200 opponent average and 79 strikeouts in 74 innings.  He tied Norberto Gonzalez for 7th in the league in strikeouts.  On December 20, 2008, Chapman broke Maels Rodríguez's record for fastest pitch in Cuban history when he reached 102 mph on the radar gun. \n Chapman pitched for Cuba in the 2009 WBC, going 0-1 with a 5.68 ERA despite 8 strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.  He dueled Travis Blackley evenly in Cuba's 5-4 win over Australia; after 3 solid innings, he gave up a Luke Hughes double in the 4th, balked him to third and allowed a single to Ben Risinger to tie the game at one.  He got the start in a key match against Japan and hit 100 mph on the radar but struggled in a loss to Daisuke Matsuzaka.  He helped his own cause by picking off Michihiro Ogasawara and Seiichi Uchikawa after walking them in the 2nd.  In the third, he gave up singles to Kenji Johjima and Akinori Iwamura.  Ichiro Suzuki bunted back to Chapman, who threw to third for a force.  Yasuyuki Kataoka singled and Chapman was yanked in favor of Norberto González, who let all 3 inherited runners score. Chapman went 11-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 2008-2009, striking out 130 in 118 1/3 innings.  He led the Serie Nacional in strikeouts, 11 ahead of Yunieski Maya, tied for 4th in wins, was 5th with 62 walks and tied for the most wild pitches (14).  While Chapman won the headlines with his flame-throwing, Maikel Folch was named Cuba's best left-handed pitcher that year.\n Chapman defected from Cuba just before the 2009 World Port Tournament started.  He established residency in the small European principality of Andorra, making him a free agent eligible to be signed by any MLB team.  After auditioning for several teams, he signed a contract with the Cincinnati Reds on January 11, 2010, worth $30.25 million over six years.  The deal was comparable to the package offered by the Washington Nationals to Stephen Strasburg, the top pick in the 2009 amateur draft.  Until he defected, his birth date was listed as September 11, 1987; he declared a different birth date at that time, which made him six months younger.  The Reds assigned Chapman to the AAA Louisville Bats.  In his debut, he hit 101 mph three times on the radar gun and fanned 9 in 4 2/3 innings versus the Toledo Mud Hens, allowing only one run.  He gave up five singles and one walk, but Toledo manager Larry Parrish said \"Today, he walked one. In the big leagues, he would've walked eight.\"  He was 9-6 with eight saves and a 3.57 ERA for Louisville, striking out 125 in just 95 2/3 innings.  He allowed a .218 average but walked 52 and threw 14 wild pitches, showing the same high-whiff, high-walk totals he had back in Cuba.  He was also 4-for-10 with a double and a walk at the plate.\n Chapman joined the Reds on August 31, 2010, the last day on which he could be eligible for postseason play.  In his debut, he pitched one perfect inning in relief against the Milwaukee Brewers, hitting 102 mph on the gun.  The next day, he hit 104 mph and got his first win with another perfect inning of relief; the Reds scored six runs in the bottom of the frame to beat the Brewers, 6-1.  On September 24th, he became the first hurler timed at 105 mph during a major league game.  He ended the season with a 2-2 record in the majors, a 2.03 ERA and 19 strikeouts (against only 9 hits) in 13 1/3 innings.  He pitched twice in the NLDS against the Philadelphia Phillies, giving up three unearned runs in 1 2/3 innings and being charged with a loss.  Chapman began the 2011 season in the Reds' bullpen as the main set-up man for closer Francisco Cordero.  He only gave up 6 hits in his first 13 innings over 16 games, but struggled with his control, walking 20 against 15 strikeouts for a 6.92 ERA.  On May 16th, he was placed on the disabled list with inflammation in his left shoulder.  He came back on June 25th, and pitched better the rest of the way, lowering his ERA to 3.60 by the time the season ended.  He finished the year with a 4-1 record in 54 games, and a save, having given up a mere 24 hits in 50 innings but 41 walks.  There was no doubt about his raw stuff, as he struck out 71 batters, which represents 12.8 strikeouts per 9 innings, the same as in his first season.\n He was still set-up man for the Reds at the start of the 2012 season, despite Cordero's departure in free agency and his potential replacement, Ryan Madson, being lost for the season to an arm injury.  It was offseason acquisition Sean Marshall who was tasked with closing out games.  For his part, Aroldis pitched lights out, keeping a clean sheet over his first 17 games, during which he pitched 21 1/3 innings, allowed only 7 hits and 7 walks while striking out 38.  He picked up three wins but had not yet had an opportunity to save a game when manager Dusty Baker gave him the ball to record the last three outs of a 5-2 win over the New York Yankees on May 20th for his first save.  That left more questions over what his most effective role on the team should be: set-up man, closer, or even a starter, as he had been in Cuba.  Just after midnight the following day, he made the news for a different reason, when he was arrested in Grove City, OH for driving 93 mph on Interstate 71... with a suspended license.  Reds GM Walt Jocketty downplayed the arrest as a simple speeding ticket, stating that \"He likes to drive his car fast\".  More serious was the news which surfaced the same day that a Cuban-American man now serving a 10-year jail sentence in Cuba was suing Aroldis for $18 million; Danilo Curbelo Garcia claimed he was arrested for human trafficking based on false accusations made by Chapman in 2008, at a time he was trying to gain favors with Cuban authorities in order to be allowed to travel abroad.  More legal issues arose when a woman named Claudia Manrique claimed she was tied up and robbed of $200,000 while in Chapman's hotel room in Pittsburgh; she later failed a polygraph and pleaded guilty to making false reports to police.\n Chapman's streak of scoreless appearances eventually reached 24 games and 29 innings before he gave up a 10th-inning run-scoring double to the Pittsburgh Pirates' Michael McKenry on June 7th in a 5-4 loss.  That game heralded the beginning of a rough patch for Arold, who went through a seven-game stretch in June during which his ERA was 11.37 with two blown saves.  When he snapped out of the funk on June 26th, striking out the side against the Milwaukee Brewers to pick up his 9th save in a 4-3 win, he celebrated with two forward somersaults in front of the mound, a bit of excessive celebration which was frowned upon by traditionalists, but understandable in the circumstances.  Still, he was told in no uncertain terms by manager Dusty Baker not to do it again: \"It's been addressed,\" Baker said.  \"It's over with. It won't happen again, ever.\" Chapman was named to the All-Star team for the first time in 2012 and regained his dominance quickly.  On August 12th, he registered his 28th save, having saved all three games of a weekend sweep of the Chicago Cubs.  At that point, he had recorded a save in his last 16 appearances, breaking the Reds' team record of 15 set by Jeff Shaw in 1997, and had not been scored on in 22 straight appearances.  Not counting interleague games, his ERA was 0.17 (overall, it was 1.26), he had recorded at least one strikeout in 52 of 53 outings, and had 106 strikeouts against a mere 25 hits in 57 innings.  He was well ahead of the record pace of 15.99 strikeouts per 9 innings set by Carlos Marmol in 2010.  He began to show signs of fatigue in early September, with his velocity down, and the Reds decided to rest him, as they held a sizable lead in the NL Central.  He pitched on September 11th, then rested until completing a 6-0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers that clinched the division on September 22nd.  He finished the year with 38 saves and a 1.51 ERA, striking out 122 in 71 2/3 innings against only 35 hits and 23 walks.  He tied Jonathan Papelbon for third in the NL in saves, four behind co-leaders Craig Kimbrel and Jason Motte.  He was not much of a factor in the postseason, giving up one run over three innings without a decision as the Reds were beaten by the San Francisco Giants in five games in the NLDS.\n Going into 2013, the Reds decided to convert Chapman to a starting role in order to maximize his value.  That was how he was used in spring training; however, he came out and said that he would have preferred to remain as a closer but that the matter was out of his hands.  In the end, the Reds relented, announcing on March 22nd that Chapman would again be their closer, and that Mike Leake would take the vacant fifth starter spot.  In the 2013 All-Star Game, Chapman relieved Jose Fernandez in the top of the 7th with a 2-0 deficit.  He walked Nelson Cruz but got Edwin Encarnacion to hit into a double play then struck out Adam Jones; Kimbrel relieved him in the 8th.  Chapman finished 4-5 with 38 saves, a 2.54 ERA, 37 hits, 29 walks and 112 strikeouts in 63 2/3 innings. He tied Sergio Romo for third in the NL in saves, behind Kimbrel and Rafael Soriano.  Chapman finally met his now four-year-old daughter, Ashanti, before the start of the 2014 season.  She had been born to his wife, Raildelmi, after Chapman's defection, and the two were finally allowed to leave for the United States after four years of wrangling.  His marriage had fallen victim to the long wait, as he and he his wife were no longer a couple, but being able to see his daughter and know she and her mother were safe was a huge relief.  His parents had successfully made it out of Cuba a year earlier, and Chapman was now taking care of the needs of all four close family members.  On March 19th, he suffered a scary injury while pitching in the 6th inning of a routine Cactus League game against the Kansas City Royals.  He had been laboring with his control all inning when he threw a 99-mph fastball to Royals batter Santiago Perez, who hit a screaming line drive up the middle.  Chapman had no time to react as the ball struck him flush in the face, sending him tumbling to the ground.  He had to be evacuated on a stretcher and to a hospital where he was diagnosed with fractures above the left eye and in his nose and multiple lacerations.  The two teams decided to stop the game at that point, with the blessing of home plate umpire Chris Guccione.  Given the force of the blow, Chapman was lucky to escape with only a couple of fractures, as it could have easily resulted in a serious eye or brain injury.  Still, he was expected to be out of action for two months and, slightly ahead of schedule, made his debut on May 11th, when he struck out the side and flashed his trademark 100 mph fastball in picking up a save in a 4-1 win over the Colorado Rockies.  He continued as if nothing had happened, earning a third straight All-Star berth.  On July 11th, he set a record when he recorded at least one strikeout in his 40th straight relief appearance, striking out the side and picking up his 20th save of the year over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Bruce Sutter had set the previous record with at least one strikeout in 39 straight relief outings in 1977.  Chapman recorded his 100th career save on July 29th in a 3-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks and, at the same time, extended his streak of appearances with at least one strikeout to 45; in a typical effort, 15 of his 20 pitches were timed over 100 mph.  The streak finally ended at 49 games while picking up his 26th save against the Rockies on August 15th.  He established a new record for most K/9 IP for a pitcher with 50 or more innings, with 17.67; he also set marks for most strikeouts per hit allowed (5.05) with 106 strikeouts in 54 innings, while allowing only 21 hits and 24 walks.  His record was 0-3, but with an ERA of 2.00 and 36 saves in 38 opportunities.\n The Reds, and especially their bullpen, struggled in the first half of 2015 - but not Aroldis.  He picked up 18 saves, to go along with a 3-3 record and a 1.61 ERA to be named to the All-Star team for the fourth straight year.  During the game, he struck out the side in his only inning of work, hitting 100 mph on every one of his pitches.  At that point of the season, he had thrown more pitches of three-digit velocity than all other major league pitchers combined!  On July 19th, he set another record in recording 5 strikeouts over 2 innings in his first outing of more than one inning of the season, becoming the quickest pitcher to reach 500 strikeouts.  Number 500 came in his 292nd inning of work, beating the record of 305 innings set earlier that season by Craig Kimbrel.  He finished the year at 4-4, 1.63, with 33 saves and 116 strikeouts in 66 1/3 innings.  One astonishing statistic was that he threw the 77 fastest pitches in the major leagues that year.  The pitcher who came closest to him was Nathan Eovaldi, whose fastest offering hit 101.6 mph on the radar gun.  Chapman threw 336 pitches measured at 100 mph or more, while the rest of the major leagues combined for 226.\n With a year remaining on his contract at the end of the season, and the Reds rebuilding, he became the subject of speculation regarding a possible trade to a contending team.  On December 7th, a number of sources announced he had been traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, but that deal fell through.  One of the reasons is that, that same day, reports emerged Chapman had been involved in a domestic violence incident on October 30th during which a number of shots had been fired and, while no charges had yet been laid, the matter was still being investigated by authorities and could lead to a suspension by Major League Baseball under its new domestic violence policy.  On December 28th, the Reds did find a taker for Chapman as he was traded to the New York Yankees for four minor leaguers: infielders Eric Jagielo and Tony Renda, and right-handed pitchers Caleb Cotham and Rookie Davis.  He was joining a bullpen that already featured two power arms in Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances, leading to speculation that the trio could put up ungodly strikeout numbers together.  On January 11, 2016, manager Joe Girardi made a surprise announcement, telling reporters that Chapman was his closer heading into spring training.  A week after that, the Broward County, Florida, State attorney's office issued a statement saying that after completing their investigation, they would not be filing charges against Chapman after the domestic violence incident.  Still, Commissioner Rob Manfred judged the incident to be sufficiently serious to justify a first suspension under MLB's domestic violence policy.  The suspension, announced on March 1st, was for 30 games from the start of the season and was worked out in consultation with the Players Association.  For his part, Chapman admitted that his actions had been regrettable and announced he would not appeal it.  His claim that he had not harmed his girlfriend in any way drew criticism from advocates for victims, who pointed out that intimidation and psychological harm caused in such an incident was significant and should not be underplayed.\n In the end, he was given permission to return after 29 games, because one of the Yankees' scheduled games had been cancelled, making it back on May 9.  On July 18, he recorded a speed of 105.1 mph on the gun while facing J.J. Hardy of the Baltimore Orioles, matching his own record for the fastest pitch in major league history.  It was a ball, low and inside, forcing Hardy to bail out.  Hardy then flied out and Chapman recorded his 19th save.  As the end of July approached, rumors of an upcoming trade multiplied, as it was clear that the presence of three top-tier relievers on the Yankees was not an optimal use of resources with other areas of the teams in need of improvement.  The Chicago Cubs were the team most mentioned as a likely destination for Aroldis.  The rumored deal was completed on July 25th, with the Yankees receiving a nice haul in return: outfielders Rashad Crawford and Billy McKinney, infielder Gleyber Torres and pitcher Adam Warren.  Chapman was 3-0, 2.01 with 20 saves in 21 opportunities in his 31 games for the Yankees.  He made his first appearance for the Cubs on July 27th and delivered a perfect 9th inning in front of a pumped-up sellout Wrigley Field crowd, although there was little pressure given the Cubs were leading the crosstown Chicago White Sox, 9-1, at the time.  It was a typical performance, as he threw 12 pitches of 14 pitches over 100 mph, the other two being nasty sliders, and struck out two batters while former teammate Todd Frazier could only manage a weak grounder to shortstop.  He picked up his first save as a Cub the next day when he recorded the last four outs of a 3-1 win over the White Sox.  He went 1-1 with a 1.01 ERA and 16 saves in 28 outings for the Cubs, giving him a combined mark of 4-1, 1.55 and 36 saves with 90 strikeouts in 58 innings.  In the postseason, he played a key role in the Cubs clinching their first World Series title in 108 years as he recorded 3 saves in 4 appearances against the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS, won a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, and recorded another win and save in the Fall Classic facing the Cleveland Indians.  He was used for much longer stretches than he was accustomed during the postseason, and was clearly showing signs of fatigue by the time Game 7 of the World Series rolled around.  In that game, on November 2, he came out with two outs in the 8th, a runner on base and the Cubs leading 6-3, but gave up a double to Brandon Guyer and a homer to Rajai Davis to tie the score.  Still, he returned to pitch a perfect bottom of the 9th, setting the table for the Cubs' winning rally in the top of the 10th and was credited with the historic series-clinching 8-7 win.\n Chapman became a free agent after the 2016 season and, on December 8th, he cashed in on the high demand for proven closers, returning to the Yankees on a five-year deal worth $86 million.  After his departure, Dellin Betances had had some struggles as the team's closer, prompting the Yankees to splurge.  After the signing was complete, Chapman told the media: \"Personally, I don’t agree with the way he [Joe Maddon] used me [in the postseason].\"  He was referring in particular to what he felt was an unneeded outing when the Cubs had a huge lead in the final innings of Game 6, resulting in his coming in tired in a crucial situation in Game 7.  Whether or not it was linked to his overuse, Chapman went on the disabled list on May 14, 2017, with inflammation in his left shoulder.  He was 1-0, 3.55 in 14 games with 7 saves at the time, but had given up 4 runs in his final two outings before going on the DL after only giving up 1 in his first 12 appearances.  He missed over a month of action, returning on June 18th, but was not his usual dominant self.  This was apparent in a crucial series against the Boston Red Sox in early August, when he gave up 3 walks and a run before saving a game on August 11.   Then, he blew a save three days later when he gave a game-tying homer to rookie Rafael Devers in the 9th, and the winning run in the 10th, at a point when the Yankees could have closed in within 2 1/2 games of first place.  This immediately prompted calls from armchair quarterbacks to demote him to a set-up role and let Dellin Betances or David Robertson take over.  After a couple of other difficult outings, on August 19th, Girardi relented and stated that he was going to go with a closer by committee.  That only lasted so long, and Chapman finished the year with a record of 4-3, 3.22 and 22 saves in 52 outings.  He was solid in the postseason, pitching a scoreless inning to close the Yankees' win over the Minnesota Twins in the Wild Card Game and contributing 2 saves with a 0.00 ERA in their upset win over the Cleveland Indians in the Division Series.  In the ALCS against the Houston Astros, he was charged with the loss in Game 2 on October 14th when he replaced David Robertson in the bottom of the 9th with the score tied at 1 and, after striking out Josh Reddick, allowed a singled to Jose Altuve and a double to Carlos Correa that ended the game.  He saved a 6-4 win in Game 4 in his only other outing, his usage being limited by the fact that this was the only late-inning lead to be saved for the Yanks in the entire series.\n Chapman had an outstanding first half for the Yankees in 2018, even if some new blood, most notably Jordan Hicks, was challenging his position as the hardest thrower in the majors.  He put up an ERA of 1.38 during the first half, with 25 saves, and was named to the All-Star team for the fifth time, his first as a representative of the AL.  He decided to skip the game in order to rest a bothersome left knee.  On August 22nd, he was placed on the disabled list because of a flare-up of the tendinitis in his knee; he had to leave a game the preceding day after making just 6 pitches in the 12th inning trying to preserve a 2-1 lead over the Miami Marlins. Tommy Kahnle stepped in and recorded the save, and the Yankees had a number of experienced former closers on hand, but it was yet another injury to a key member of the team, after those that had put Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez on the shelf for extended periods.  He finished the year at 3-0, 2.45 with 32 saves, then did not give up a run in 3 postseason appearances.  He had another solid season in 2019, making his 6th trip to the All-Star Game and winning, for the first time, the Mariano Rivera Award as the best relief pitcher in the AL.  He went 3-2, 2.21 with 37 saves during the season with 85 strikeouts in 57 innings.  It all ended in tears; in Game 6 of the NLCS against the Houston Astros, he gave up a series-ending two-run homer to Jose Altuve with two outs in the bottom of the 9th, after the Yankees had managed to tie the game on a two-run homer of their own, by D.J. LeMahieu, in the top of the inning.  He had not given up a run in 4 appearances in the postseason prior to that, picking up a pair of saves.  On November 2nd, he announced that he had signed an extension to stay with the Yankees for three more years, for $48 million.  He could have opted out of the final years of his contract at that point.\n On July 11, 2020, it was announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would need to be absent from the field for the foreseeable future, even though he experienced only mild symptoms. He was the third Yankees player to test positive, following LeMahieu and P Luis Cessa. As a result, he only made his first appearance of the year on August 17th and had pitched only three times by the end of the month. He did play regularly in September, but in total, he compiled just 11 2/3 innings in 13 games, with a record of 1-1 with 3 saves and an ERA of 3.09. On September 1st, he was involved in an incident in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays in which he threw a 101 mph fastball near the head of Mike Brosseau. He was handed a three-game suspension, but appealed it and did not have time to serve it before the season ended (after the season, the appeal was finally heard, and the suspension was reduced to two games). Ironically, Chapman faced Brosseau again at a critical moment in the 8th inning of Game 5 of the Division Series, and after a prolonged at-bat, Brosseau hit a two-run homer that basically eliminated the Yankees, as they were unable to score in the top of the 9th and lost the game and the series. It was the second straight year that Chapman had served up a gopher ball at the worst possible time in the postseason.\n In 2021, he was named an All-Star for the seventh time, even though he went through a rough patch in June, when the Yankees almost fell out of contention. Both he and the team recovered and on August 26th, he recorded the 300th save of his career in a 7-6 win over the Oakland Athletics. It was New York's 12th straight win, their longest winning streak since 1961. He ended up at 6-4, 3.36, with his 8th season of 30 or more saves, getting exactly that number. However, he did not get to pitch in the postseason, as the Yankees trailed the Boston Red Sox early in the Wild Card Game and there was never an opportunity to use him before they lost the game, 6-2. 2022 was a tough season, as he went on the injured list at the end of May with an Achilles tendon injury. He had not started very well, as his ERA was 4.98 at the time. He only returned in July, by which time he had lost the closer's role to Clay Holmes. He had 9 saves before the injury, and did not add another one in July or August and barely lowered his ERA, to 4.70, when he returned on the IL on August 27th, retroactive to August 24th. The cause was an unusual time this time: a tattoo infection on his leg that was being treated with antibiotics. This came at a time when the Yankees' bullpen had been wracked by injuries. He was back on September 17th and pitched better down the stretch, going 2-1, 3.18 in 7 outings, but was still only the shadow of his former self. And then on October 7th, he went AWOL as the Yankeed held a work-out in New York to prepare for the upcoming Division Series. He turned up in Miami, FL two days later with no valid explanation and was immediately removed from the postseason roster, having made his last appearance in a Yankees uniform.\n On January 19, 2023, the Kansas City Royals, well aware of his recent issues, rolled the dice and signed him to a one-year deal for $3.75 million plus performance bonuses. It was a low-risk and potentially high-reward move, if Chapman was serious about regaining his status as an elite closer away from the distractions of pitching for the Yankees. In 31 games for Kansas City, he went 4-2, 2.45 with 2 saves and 53 strikeouts in 29 1/3 innings, but also 20 walks. The Royals were having a dreadful season and most of the rare save opportunities went to nominal closer Scott Barlow. On June 30th, the Royals traded Chapman to the Texas Rangers, one of the best teams in the American League in return for Cole Ragans and low-level minor leaguer Roni Cabrera. He was to be a set-up man for closer Will Smith. He continued to be a bit erratic, going 2-3, 3.72 in 30 games with 4 saves and 50 strikeouts in 29 innings, and while it was José Leclerc who was given a shot at closer when Smith faltered, the Rangers were quite happy with Chapman's performance. He helped a bullpen that was among the worst in the majors find some stability and helped carry the team through the postseason, all the way to the first World Series title in team history. Even if Ragans gave signs of being a future top-rank starting pitcher, flags fly forever as the saying goes, and it's unlikely the Rangers could have put together their unlikely run to the title with Chapman's contribution. He pitched 9 times in the postseason, a total of 8 innings, giving up just 2 runs and striking out 6 as one of a number of key men to which Bruce Bochy could turn at key situations on must-win games.\n Aroldis became a free agent after the 2023 season, and while no team was willing to bet the farm on his being a top closer again, the Pittsburgh Pirates agreed with him on a one-year contract for $10.5 million for 2024. The hope was that he would help to get the team's bullpen, already a strength, into elite territory, but there was also the possibility to deal him for a useful return at the trading deadline, just as the Royals had done the year before, if the Bucs turned out not to be quite ready to contend."},

He had been called up from the AAA Buffalo Bisons where he was a starter, after having begin the year in AA with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, going a combined 5-1, 1.92 between the two stops. A number of Buffalo pitchers had received a call to give a hand in the Blue Jays' bullpen, given a rash of injuries there, whereas the group of starters for the big league club was very stable. In his debut, which came on the same day he was called up, he had the unfortunate assignment of facing the red-hot New York Yankees after Yusei Kikuchi and Adam Cimber had combined to give them 6 runs over the first 5 innings. Max was not much better, as he gave up a pair of solo homers in his sole inning of work, to Kyle Higashioka and Marwin Gonzalez, to make the score 8-3 in the middle of the 6th. Somehow, the Jays managed to come back and win the game, 10-9. He returned to Buffalo after the game.\n Castillo was originally signed by Toronto on September 25, 2015 as an international amateur free agent out of Venezuela. He began pitching in their system in 2016 and methodically made it through all the levels in the system, starting with the DSL Blue Jays, but also stopping with the GCL Blue Jays, Bluefield Blue Jays, Lansing Lugnuts, Dunedin Blue Jays, before New Hampshire and Toronto. Indeed, the only affiliate for which he did not pitch were the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League. He put up some good win/loss records during his apprenticeship, including going 6-0 for Bluefield in 2017, 10-5 for Lansing in 2018 and 11-5 for Dunedin in 2019, along with an ERA of 2.69. He was emerging as an interesting fringe prospect at that point, but then missed the entire 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic. When he returned in 2021, he was assigned to New Hampshire in the Eastern League and had another solid won/loss mark, at 11-4, but his 4.85 ERA was not so impressive and kept him off most prospect lists. He was hardly mentioned as someone to watch when spring training got under way in 2022.\n After his initial rough outing, he was sent back to AAA but returned to the majors on June 24th when Yimi Garcia was placed on the injured list. He showed that he could be a useful major league pitcher the next day when Kikuchi was again chased early in a start against the Milwaukee Brewers, after completing only two innings. Trent Thornton pitched two scoreless innings, then Maximo got the ball and proceeded to go four innings during which he allowed only 1 hit and struck out 7 batters. His combined good work with Thornton not only saved Toronto's bullpen from potential disaster, but allowed the Jays to almost mount another great comeback: trailing 5-0 when Kikuchi was chased from the game, they managed to close the gap to 5-4 and had the tying run on base when closer Josh Hader recorded the final out. Diaz had impressed enough that observers immediately began to say that he should be the one starting the game the next time the ineffective Kikuchi was scheduled to start in a few days' time. He ended up making 9 appearances for Toronto, including a couple of starts with no decisions and a 3.05 ERA in 20 2/3 innings.

He was a solid staple of the Boston Red Sox outfield from 2013 to 2020, winning two World Series rings, before moving on.\n As a high school senior, Bradley was All-State.  As a freshman at South Carolina, he hit .349/.431/.537 with 69 runs scored in 63 games and was a consensus Freshman All-American.  That summer, he batted .275/.351/.366 for the Hyannis Mets of the elite Cape Cod League, leading the loop with four triples.  His sophomore year, 2010, Bradley improved to .368/.473/.587 with 13 homers, 56 runs scored and 60 RBI in 67 games while making only one error all year.  He made second-team All-SEC in the outfield.  He went 10 for 29 with two homers and 9 RBI in the 2010 College World Series to lead South Carolina to its first title and had three hits when South Carolina knocked off #1-ranked Arizona State from the Series.  In the finale, he caught a Brett Krill liner at the warning track in the 11th inning. He was named the Most Outstanding Player in the CWS for his efforts.\n Bradley was selected by the Boston Red Sox with the 40th pick of the 2011 amateur draft, a compensation pick as a result of third baseman Adrian Beltre signing with the Texas Rangers as a free agent.  Scouted by Quincy Boyd, he was signed for a reported $1.1 million.  He made his pro debut that summer with the Lowell Spinners and the Greenville Drive, hitting .250 with a home run in 10 games between the two clubs.  He split 2012 between the Class A Salem Red Sox, where he hit .359 in 67 games, and the AA Portland Sea Dogs, where he hit .271.  Between the two stops, his batting line was .315/.430/.482 with 42 doubles, 9 homers, 90 runs scored and 63 RBI.  He also drew 87 walks.\n Bradley went to spring training with the Red Sox as a non-roster player in 2013 and was outstanding, hitting over .400 and displaying a great approach at the plate that put him in the picture to begin the season in Boston.  He was the Red Sox's starter in left field on Opening Day against the New York Yankees at New Yankee Stadium on April 1st, going 0 for 2, but with three walks, two runs scored and an RBI as Boston won handily, 8-2.  The Red Sox started the season playing very well, finding themselves atop the AL East after two weeks, but Bradley was not hitting, having gone 3 for 31 in his first 12 games, and spending increasing time on the bench.  With David Ortiz ready to come off the disabled list, the Sox decided to send Bradley to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox on April 19th, in order to give him regular playing time.  Unfazed by his struggles at the big league level, Bradley quickly found his stroke with Pawtucket, and had his average up to .354 after 20 games, at which point, Boston called him back on May 29th.  He still could not master major league pitching and finished with an average of .189 in 37 games.  He was not included on the roster when the Sawx won the World Series.\n In 2014, Bradley got an extended shot at being the Red Sox's starting center fielder, but he again struggled at the plate.  In 127 games, he failed to make it above the Mendoza Line, ending the year with a batting average of .197.  It was not as if he was compensating for the low average with other facets of his game: his OBP was .265 and his slugging percentage an anemic .266, with 19 doubles but only 2 triples and a homer, for an OPS+ of 50, making him one of the least productive regulars in the majors.  He lost his job to converted infielder Mookie Betts towards the end of the year.  He was back with Pawtucket for most of 2015, where he hit a solid .305/.382/.472 in 71 games.  He continued to struggle against major league pitching during three separate stints with the big league club.  On August 9th, he was hitting only .121 with one extra-base hit - a homer - in 28 games when he broke out for a 2 for 3 game in which he had a triple, a homer and 5 RBI to lead Boston to a 7-2 win over the Detroit Tigers and give top pitching prospect Henry Owens his maiden big league victory.  That started a hot streak which culminated in a game for the ages on August 15th, as he went 5 for 6 with 3 doubles, 2 homers, 5 runs scored and 7 RBI to lead Boston to a 22-10 win over the Seattle Mariners.  He was the first player in Red Sox history to have five extra-base hits in one game, doing so from the 9th slot in the lineup.  Playing every day, he managed to raise his average to .312 with a 4-for-4 game against the Toronto Blue Jays in which he hit his 8th homer of the year on September 7th.  He then went into a 1-for-32 slump before breaking out in spectacular fashion on September 19th with a game-tying double in the 7th and a two-run homer off closer Roberto Osuna in the 9th as Boston defeated Toronto, 7-6.  He ended the season at .249 in 74 games, with 17 doubles, 4 triples and 10 homers for a .498 slugging percentage and an OPS+ of 119, putting him back in the center of the team's future plans.\n Bradley started 2016 where he left off the previous season, as he was the hottest hitter in the majors in May.  On May 18th, he homered in his first at-bat of the second game of a day-night doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, the longest in the majors that season.  His batting average was now .338, and he had hit 7 doubles, 3 triples and 7 homers during the stretch.  He made it 25 games when he homered off Corey Kluber of the Cleveland Indians in the 2nd inning on May 20th; it also marked the 20th straight game in which the Red Sox hit a homer, breaking a team record dating back to 1996.  The hitting streak ended at 29 games on May 26th, when he went 0 for 4 in an 8-2 loss to the Colorado Rockies, at which point he passed the baton for the longest extant streak to his teammate Xander Bogaerts, who had hit safely in 19 games.  He was named the American League Player of the Month for May, having hit .381 with 7 doubles, 8 homers and 24 RBI in 27 games during the month.  He cooled down after that, but still made the All-Star team for the first time and set personal bests with 156 games, 30 doubles, 7 triples, 26 homers, 94 runs and 87 RBI.  He also batted .267 and played excellent defense in center field as Boston won a division title.  In his first postseason appearance, he went 1 for 10 in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians.\n In 2017 Bradley's production fell back to some extent, especially his extra base hits, and he was generally batting from the bottom of the batting order.  Still, his excellent defensive play was unabated, and he continued to be a quality player if no longer performing at an All-Star level.  On August 22nd, he sprained his thumb while sliding into home plate and was immediately placed on the disabled list.  The Red Sox made a trade to acquire veteran center fielder Rajai Davis from the Oakland Athletics the next day.  Jackie was able to come back by early September, and played regularly the rest of the way to finish the year at .245 in 133 games, with 17 homers and 63 RBI.  In the Division Series, he was 3 for 15 with a homer and 5 RBI as the Sox were defeated in four games by the Houston Astros.  He had another subpar season with the bat in 2018, but otherwise it was a memorable one.  He hit .234 in 144 games with 13 homers and 59 RBI, good for an OPS+ of 89, but his defense in center field was stellar, earning him his first Gold Glove.  Others on the team, most notably Betts, Bogaerts and new acquisition J.D. Martinez, supplied the base hits while he was busy taking them away, and the Red Sox had one of their best seasons ever.  In the postseason, he was the MVP of the 2018 ALCS, which Boston won in five games over the Astros, by driving in 9 runs even though he had just 3 hits: all three were well-timed and went for extra bases, quality clearly trumping quantity in this instance.  He had three more hits, including a homer, in 13 at-bats in the 2018 World Series, which Boston won in five games over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n Bradley started slow with the bat in 2019, as he hit just .148 in 26 games in March and April with no homers and 5 RBI. His defensive play remained superlative. On May 8th, he robbed Trey Mancini of the Baltimore Orioles of what would have been a walk-off homer in the 11th inning by leaping over the center field fence at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and catching the ball a good two feet above it. The Sox went on win the game, 2-1, in 12 innings thanks to his amazing catch. That win put the team back at .500 after a very tough first few weeks when they were as many as 7 games below .500. His bat remained tepid, finishing .225 with 21 homers and 62 RBI in 147 games, while his glove enabled him to lead all center fielders in assists with 10. In 2020, he quietly had a much better year with the bat while playing in 55 of Boston's 60 games in a season cut short by the Coronavirus pandemic. He hit .283 with 7 homers and 22 RBIs for an OPS+ of 118, basically matching his output of 2015 and 2016, but no one mentioned it as the Sox had a terrible year, finishing dead last in the AL East. There was some talk that he would be traded to another team at the trading deadling, but it was his outfield partner, Kevin Pillar, a rather similar player, who was dealt. \n Jackie became a free agent after the 2020 season after 8 seasons with the Red Sox, and it took him some time to find a new team. Spring training was already started when on March 4th he came to an agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers on a two-year deal reportedly worth $24 million. His defensive play was as good as ever and he was the Brewers' most-used centerfielder in a year in which they won a division title, but his contribution with the bat was abysmeal: he hit just .163 in 134 games with 6 homers and  29 RBIs. His OPS+ was 34, incredibly low for a player who that much playing time. By the time the postseason rolled around, he was solidly ensonsed on the bench however, and he only appeared in one game, without coming to the plate, when the Brewers lost the Division Series to the Atlanta Braves. Following the disappointing season on December 1st, he was traded to back to the Red Sox in return for OF Hunter Renfroe, who in contrast was coming off a very solid season. To make up the difference, the Brewers threw in a cople of prospects, IFs David Hamilton and Alex Binelas. While he hit better in Boston in 2022 the he had in Milwaukee the year before, it was still no great shakes: a .210 average in 91 games,, 3 homers, 29 RBIs and an OPS+ of 58. On August 4th, the Red Sox elected to release him. Less than a week later, on August 9th, he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays. He hit .178 in 40 games for Toronto to finish at .203 in 131 games and went 0 for 1 in the Wild Card Series after replacing CF George Springer when he suffered an injury late in the second game.\n In 2023, he went to spring training with the Kansas City Royals.\n Primary Source: Gamecocks bio"},

After a 2018 season in the minors where he played relatively little due to injuries, he started well in 2019 with the Oklahoma City Dodgers and was brought up to the big leagues in late April, sent down, brought back and became part of the rookie threesome (with Will Smith and Alex Verdugo) who hit walk-off home runs in consecutive games.  His was the first of the three hit on June 21.  Matt was able to get into 99 games in his rookie season, in part because of injuries to regulars, but also because he did well as a pinch-hitter for the Dodgers.  His season would have been even better, but he went into a slump in September, when he hit just .222.  He finished at .265 with 9 homers and 46 RBI, then went 3 for 8 in the Dodgers' upset loss to the Washington Nationals in the Division Series.\n In 2020, the National League used the DH rather than letting pitchers hit, so Beaty's services as a pinch-hitter were needed less. He got spotty playing time and was sent down in September. In all, he appeared in 21 games, hitting .220 with 2 homers and 5 RBIs in 50 at-bats. However, he was added to the team for the post-season, although he was used sparingly: he had just 3 plate appearances as the Dodgers won a World Series title for the first time since 1988, and they all came in the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves. Interestingly, the three plate appearances did not result in any at-bats, as he walked one, and was hit by a pitch twice for a perfect 1.000 OBP. He saw a lot more action in 2021, as he appeared in 120 games and hit .270 with 7 homers and 40 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 107. He only had 204 at-bats in spite of all the games, as 62 of them were as a pinch-hitter and another 2 as a pinch-runner. He had 20 starts in left firld, 16 at first base and 9 in right field. He then went 1 for 11 in the postseason, his lone hit being an RBI single as a pinch-hitter in Game 2 of the Division Series in a 9-2 win over the San Francisco Giants.\n Heading into 2022, the National League adopted the universal DH, which should in theory have opened up some playing time for him, but then the Dodgers immediately signed 1B Freddie Freeman to a large free agent deal. With Max Muncy still around, it meant that there was still no starting job for Matt, and that if he made the team it would again be as a pinch-hitter - with the need for such greatly diminished by the adoption of the DH - and occsional back-up in the outfield. The numbers did not work for him: on March 23rd, he was designated for assignment, but on March 28th, the Dodgers swung a rare trade with division rivals the San Diego Padres, sending him south in return for minor league P River Ryan. Contrary to the Dodgers, the Padres had a need for an extra outfielder and bench player.\n Beaty is the first non-pitcher from Belmont University to make the major leagues. Through 2019, he is the first major leaguer named Beaty. Players with similar names include Desmond Beatty, Blaine Beatty and Jim Beattie."},

Surprisingly, he had not been considered a serious prospect coming out of high school, but saw his stock rise extremely fast due to his performances with California.\n Vaughn was the third overall pick in the 2019 amateur draft, by the Chicago White Sox. He played for three different minor league teams his first season, the AZL White Sox, Kannapolis Intimidators and Winston-Salem Dash, putting up a combined line of .278/.384/.449 in 55 games. However, he was one of the multitude of minor leaguers who saw their 2020 season wiped out by the Coronavirus pandemic. He did make the White Sox's opening day roster in 2021 and when he started his team's second game of the season in left field against the Los Angeles Angels on April 2nd, a day short of his 23rd birthday, he became the first player from the 2019 draft to play in the majors. He went 0 for 3 with a run scored in his debut. Overall, he hit .235 in 127 games, with 15 homers and 48 RBIs, for a team that finished in first place in its division. He played mainly in left field, filling in during the first half of the season for an injured Eloy Jimenez, while also appearing in right field and at first base - and also making one start each at second base and third base. He could not play his usual position, first base, as Jose Abreu was a fixture there, and fellow rookies Yermin Mercedes and Gavin Sheets were the most frequent DHs. In the Division Series, he went 2 for 5 with a double in the White Sox's loss to the Houston Astros.\n In his second full season in 2022, he played 134 games and hit .271 with 17 homers and 76 RBIs, improving his OPS+ from 91 to 111. He was probably the steadiest hitter on a disappointing White Sox team that missed the postseason. He continued to play mainly in the outfield, with 45 games in right and 44 in left, but also started over 20 games at both DH and first base. Following the season, it was announced that he would move to being a full-time starter at first base in 2023, due to the departure of long-time fixture José Abreu via free agency."},

He made his major league debut with the now renamed Miami Marlins in 2015\n The hurler spent his first two campaigns with the DSL Marlins, including a 5-6, 2.61 season in 2010. He made the Dominican Summer League Mid-Season All-Star squad that year. After an off-year in 2011, he was 9-6 with a 3.38 ERA in 27 games (22 starts) for the Greensboro Grasshoppers in 2012. For the Jupiter Hammerheads in 2013, he was 10-7 with a 3.73 ERA in 27 games (26 starts). He spent 2014 with the Jacksonville Suns and earned a spot on the Southern League Mid-Season All-Star team. He was 13-8, 3.33 in 26 games for Jacksonville, 25 of them starts, logging 162 innings.\n Urena was first called up to Miami to make a couple of relief appearances in April of 2015. He got his feet wet by giving up 3 runs in 3 innings of work, but soon went back to the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs, as the Marlins saw his future as a starter and not as a reliever. He went 4-0, 1.21 in his first 6 starts for New Orleans to get a chance to make his first big league start on May 26th against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He gave up 5 runs on 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings and was charged with his team's 5-1 loss. He lost again in his second start, on June 1st, but pitched better, allowing 3 runs in 6 innings against the Chicago Cubs. He earned his first win on June 12th, 5-1 over the Colorado Rockies, pitching 6 2/3 innings. He went 1-5, 5.25 in 20 games, including 9 starts.\n In 2016, Urena was 4-9, 6.13 in 28 games, 12 of them starts. he also earned his first save and pitched 83 2/3 innings. He moved to starting almost full time in 2017 as 28 of his 34 outings came in the role. He went 14-7, having lowered his ERA to 3.82 while logging 169 2/3 innings. He struck out 113 batters, while walking 64 and compiling 14 hit batsmen, the highest total in the National League that year. With the Marlins having undergone a fire sale after the 2017 season, he was now considered one of the veteran leaders on the team as 2018 started, in spite of just being 26 with a little over two seasons of major league experience. He was designated the Marlins' opening day starter, which meant he would throw the first pitch of the major league season, as the Marlins' opener was the earliest of all of those scheduled on March 29th. The season started poorly, though, as that first pitch was hit for a homer by the Chicago Cubs' leadoff hitter, Ian Happ, and he was charged with an 8-4 loss. In fact, he went 0-7 with a 4.41 ERA over his first 12 starts before finally recording his first win of the year on June 5th. He made the news again on August 15th when he decided to take the law into his own hands and somehow thought it was a good idea to plunk Atlanta Braves leadoff hitter Ronald Acuna with his first pitch of the game, a 97 mph fastball. Acuna had been insanely hot, homering in his last five games, but the gesture led, as could have been expected, to a bench-clearing brawl and to Urena's immediate ejection. Even his manager, Don Mattingly, was reluctant to defend his pitcher after the game. He was handed a six-game suspension coupled with a fine. He appealed the suspension, allowing him to make his next start on August 19th, and ironically it turned out to be the best of his career as he unfurled his first-ever complete game in defeating the Washington Nationals, 12-1, on a two-hitter. After that game, he withdrew his appeal of the suspension and began to serve it immediately. He finished the season at 9-12, 3.98 in 31 starts, with a career high in inning - 174 - and strikeouts - 130.\n At that point, Urena seemed to have a bright future ahead of him, but his 2019 season was a tough one as poor performances cost him his spot in the starting rotation midway through - he made 13 starts in 24 appearances. Given his superior stuff, he was given a look as a short reliever and did notch 3 saves, but overall, his numbers were poor as he finished at 4-10, 5.21 with 99 hits allowed in 84 2/3 innings. He did manage to maintain his strikeout and walk rate, with 62 and 26 respectively, so the main issue was the much higher number of hits he allowed. He was given another 5 starts in the abbreviated 2020 season, all of them coming in September as he was one of a number of players on the team to be sidelined by a COVID-19 outbreak at the end of the year that threatened to wipe out the team's season. He went 0-3, 5.40 during those 5 starts, and this time it was his control that failed him: he managed to bring his hit rate back under control - 22 in 23 1/3 innings, but gave up 13 walks while striking out 15. Other young pitchers vaulted past him on the depth chart, and when as a result he was not used in the postseason, which the Marlins reached in what was a major surprise. Following the season, on November 30th, he was designated for assignment to clear a roster spot for newly-acquired reliever Adam Cimber and became a free agent. On December 23rd, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers on a one-year deal."},

He was Chicago's third pick, following Jared Mitchell and Josh Phegley. He was signed by scout George Kachigian for a bonus of $625,000. \n In his first professional season, he hit .198/.265/.245 with no home runs, 3 stolen bases, 7 walks and 41 strikeouts in 32 games (106 at-bats) between the Bristol White Sox (.188/.247/.247 in 25 G) and Great Falls Voyagers (5 for 21, 3 BB).

He hit .229/.302/.433 with 8 home runs, 31 RBI, 6 steals and 69 strikeouts in 58 games for the Kannapolis Intimidators in 2010. \n Despite his poor numbers the season before, Thompson was named the White Sox 9th-best prospect entering 2011 by Baseball America. With Kannapolis again that year, he hit .241/.329/.457 with 24 home runs, 87 RBI, 95 runs scored, 36 doubles, 8 steals and 172 strikeouts in 136 games.

He played in the South Atlantic League All-Star Game and was also dubbed a MiLB.com Organization All-Star after the campaign. Baseball America named him the SAL's #15 prospect, between Gary Sanchez and Bryce Brentz.\n Going into 2012, he was the club's 4th-best prospect as well as their best power hitter prospect, according to Baseball America. He hit .253/.328/.482 with 25 home runs, 96 RBI, 88 runs scored, 21 stolen bases and 166 strikeouts in 136 games split between the Winston-Salem Dash, Birmingham Barons (.280/.379/.520 in 14 G) and Triple-A Charlotte Knights. In his first taste of Triple-A action, he hit .167/.250/.278 in 18 at-bats. Due to his performance with Winston-Salem (116 G, 22 HR, 90 RBI, 18 SB to 3 CS), he was named a Carolina League Postseason All-Star. The other outfielders picked were Jackie Bradley Jr. and Michael Earley. Once again, MiLB.com named him an Organization All-Star. He was second to Brady Shoemaker in the White Sox chain in runs, tied Marcus Semien for second in doubles (31, 4 behind Shoemaker), was second to Dan Johnson in home runs (3 shy), was second in whiffs (13 behind Mitchell), tied Mitchell for 7th in steals and led in total bases (249, 8 ahead of Black).

He was just 1 for 22 with two walks and 7 whiffs for the Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League. Entering 2014, he was Chicago's 5th-best prospect per MLB.com and their 8th best prospect, best athlete and best power prospect according to Baseball America.\n Trayce spent 2014 in the Southern League, with the Birmingham Barons. In 133 games, he hit .237/.324/.419, with 123 hits, 34 doubles, 16 homers, 86 runs scored and 59 RBIs. He was successful on 20 of 25 steal attempts, but strikeouts remained a problem, with 151. In 2015, he continued his slow bus steady progression up the organizational ladder, being assigned to the AAA Charlotte Knights, with whom he had played briefly back in 2012. In 104 games, he was hitting .260 - his best batting average since turning pro, except for a brief stay with Birmingham in 2012 - with 23 doubles, 13 homers and 39 RBIs. He had also managed to cut down his strikeouts, with 79. On August 4th, the White Sox called him up to the Show and he made his debut as a pinch-hitter for Adam Eaton in the 7th inning of a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. He struck out against Chris Archer, then completed the game in centerfield as the White Sox lost, 11-3. He hit his first career homer on August 11th against Hector Santiago of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, a solo shot in a 3-0 win. He hit .295 with 5 homers and 16 RBIs in 44 games for Chicago. On December 16th, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers alongside Micah Johnson and Frankie Montas in return for Todd Frazier, who had been acquired by the Dodgers from the Cincinnati Reds earlier in the day.\n He ended playing more than anyone would have expected for the Dodgers in the first half of 2016, as he took advantage of injuries to play 80 games before the All-Star break, during which he hit .225 but with 11 doubles and 13 homers while splitting his time almost equally among the three outfield positions. On July 16th, however, he was placed on the disabled list with a lower back irritation and did not play in the majors again that year. In 2017, he played just 27 games in the majors, hitting only .122 with 1 homer and 2 RBIs. He spent the bulk of the year in AAA with the Oklahoma City Dodgers, where he hit just .212 in 95 games, with 9 homers and 33 RBIs. He did not see any action in the postseason in either of his season with the Dodgers. On April 3, 2018, the New York Yankees claimed him off waivers, as they were badly in need of healthy outfielders following a rash of injuries at the position. However, his stay with the Yankees only lasted two days, as he was placed on waivers again, only to be claimed by the Oakland Athletics who immediately added him to their 25-man roster. He went 1 for 7 in 3 games, then on April 19th moved to his fourth team in less than a month when he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in return for future considerations.\n He was in the majors for 48 games with the White Sox in 2018 along with 46 games for their minor league affiliate, the Charlotte Knights. The White Sox released him in November, and he signed with the Cleveland Indians. He was in 89 games with the Columbus Clippers of their organization, all in the minors. In August, he was released by the Indians. He was a non-roster invitee to the Arizona Diamondbacks spring training camp in 2020, hitting real well (.346/.452/.923) until the coronavirus postponed the remainder of the spring training season. When the season did get underway in July, he failed to make the team and with the minor leagues shut down, he did not play anywhere that year.\n He finally returned to the big leagues in 2021, after a two-year hiatus, following his purchase by the Chicago Cubs from the Diamondbacks in May. He appeared in 15 games for them at the end of the season after spending most of the year with the AAA Iowa Cubs, where he hit .233 in 88 games, but with 21 homers and 63 RBIs. In the majors, he batted .250 with 4 homers and 9 RBIs for an OPS+ of 194. He had an eventful year in Padres, as he was with three different organizations and ended up playing in the postseason for the first time of his career. He started off with the San Diego Padres hitting well for the AAA El Paso Chihuahuas (.316 in 16 games with 9 homers). He was called up to the big team in late April, but failed to hit, going 1 for 14 in 6 games. When the Padres tried to send him back to the minors, he asked for his release and signed with the Detroit Tigers a few days later. he continued to hit well with the AAA Toledo Mud Hens, batting .299 with 8 homers and 19 RBIs in 25 games and when the Los Angeles Dodgers were hit by a rash of injuries and needed an outfielder, they purchased him from Detroit on June 20th and immediately added him to their 26-man roster. That was the break he needed, as he hit well the rest of the way for a very strong Dodgers team, and got to play in all three outfield spots, hitting .268 with 13 homers and 39 RBIs. The homers matched his production as a second-year layer with the Dodgers back in 2016, and the RBIs were a personal best, and his OPS+ of 146 was excellent. In the Division Series against his former team, the Padres, he went 2 for 13 with 3 walks as Los Angeles was upset in four games.\n He started off the 2023 season with a bang as in his first start for the Dodgers, in the team's third game on April 1st, he had the first three-homer game of his career and the first in the major league that season, in a 10-1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He started things off with a grand slam off Madison Bumgarner in the 1st, added a three-run homer off Kevin Ginkel in the 5th, and capped things off with a solos hot against Carlos Vargas in the 8th to give him 8 RBIs on the day. This came after a rough spring training during which he had hit just .086, explaining why he had been benched in the team's first two games. However, things went poorly after that, and he was hitting only .155 in 36 games, with 5 homers and 14 RBIs when he went on the injured list with a strained left oblique on June 4th. He was still injured when on July 28th, he was traded back to the Chicago White Sox along with two minor leaguers, Jordan Leasure and Nick Nastrini, in return for Ps Joe Kelly and Lance Lynn."},

He was signed by scout Jim Dedrick and made his pro debut that summer.\n Shaw reached the majors with the D-Backs in 2011 and had a good first season, going 1-0, 2.34 in 33 games, all in relief. He also made four appearances in the postseason, giving up no runs and no hits in 4 innings as the Diamondbacks lost to the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLDS. However, things got tougher in 2012 as he finished 1-6, 3.49 in 64 appearances. He saved 2 games and also was credited with 10 holds. On December 11th, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians as part of a blockbuster trade that also involved the Cincinnati Reds and in which eight other players changed teams, the most prominent being Trevor Bauer, Shin-Soo Choo and Didi Gregorius.\n Shaw became one of the best middle relievers in baseball with the Indians as had at least 70 games pitched in each of five seasons he spent with the team, including three different years in which he led the American League in appearances (2014, 2016 and 2017). His 378 games pitched for the Indians was the 8th highest total in team history, and he was second in games in relief, after teammate Cody Allen. His ERAs were always good, the highest being 3.52 in his final season, 2017. He picked up at least one save each year, although it was not his main duty: he was there to set the table for the team's closers, mainly Allen and Andrew Miller, helping to form one of the best bullpens in the league, especially the final two seasons when the Indians were one of the strongest teams in baseball. He pitched in the postseason in three of those five seasons. In 2013, he pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings in Cleveland's loss to the Tampa Bay Rays in the Wild Card Game. In 2016, he pitched 11 times as the Indians made it all the way to Game 7 of the World Series, which they lost to the Chicago Cubs in heartbreaking fashion. He had been credited with a pair of wins against the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS and in the historic World Series Game 7 on November 2nd, he replaced Allen in the top of the 9th with the score tied, one out and a runner on first, and he managed to keep the Cubs from scoring. But the Indians could not score the winning run in the bottom of the frame against Aroldis Chapman and in the top of the 10th, after a brief rain delay, he allowed a lead-off single to Kyle Schwarber, then after an out and an intentional walk, a double to Ben Zobrist which put Chicago ahead. After another intentional walk, Miguel Montero singled to drive in another run, at whcih point he was replaced by Bauer, who ended the inning by retiring the next two batters. Cleveland managed to get one of the two runs back in the bottom of the 10th, but it wasn't enough and Shaw was charged with the historic 8-7 loss. In 2017, he pitched three times in the Indians' loss to the New York Yankees in the Division Series, giving up just one run in six innings.\n On December 15, 2017, he signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Rockies."},

It took him eight seasons in the minors to make it to the Show, not counting 2020 when he was forced to stay idle when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the minor leagues. He had reached AA for the first time at the end of 2019, after making the mid-season All-Star team in the Carolina League with the Winston-Salem Dash, but had hit just .232 in his 27 games with the Birmingham Barons of the Southern League. Late  in the 2020 season, he did get to spend some time as one of the few coveted invitees to the team's alternate training site where the best prospects in the organization got to mingle with players on the 40-man roster biding their time until a call-up to the Show. When play resumed a year later, he hit well for Birmingham - .296 in 13 games - but was completely stymied in AAA, finishing at .193 in 82 games for the Charlotte Knights. Still he persisted, and a season of hitting .280 and scoring 83 runs with Charlotte in 2022 put him back on the White Sox's radar. He was just hitting .236 in 59 games when he got the call to Chicago on June 15, 2023.\n He made his big league debut two days after his call-up, when he entered a game against the Seattle Mariners when SS Tim Anderson had to leave due to shoulder soreness. He took over at second base while veteran Elvis Andrus slid over to short, and the rest of the way went 3 for 3 with a walk and drove in two runs, playing a key role in a 4-3 win in 11 innings. His first big league hit was a bunt single in the 7th, and his two RBIs tied the game in the 9th, and won it for the White Sox in walk-off fashion in the 11th.\n His brother Will Remillard played in the minor leagues from 2014 to 2018.

His manager, Felipe Alou, picked him as the Expos' sole representative in the 1995 All-Star Game, where he pitched a third of an inning. He slowed down over the second half, winning only three more games as the Expos fell apart, and ended the year 10-8, 3.69. His season ended on a very bad note as on September 23rd, he was arrested in Atlanta, GA and charged with rape and sodomy. He was freed on a $50,000 bail after spending two days in jail, but did not play again. He managed to get his legal problems sorted out in the off-season. His record was good enough however to have him named to the 1995 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. \n Perez was set to pitch in the Expos' starting rotation in 1996 but in his last start of spring training on March 30th, he felt stiffness in his shoulder, then was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 4th, the day he was supposed to make his first start, with what was initially diagnosed as tendinitis. As the pain persisted, he went under the knife in early May to repair a partial tear in his shoulder joint. He missed the entire season as a result, a significant loss for the Expos who missed the National League Wild Card spot by only two games. \n Perez pitched briefly in the winter leagues in the 1996-97 off-season, then made the Expos' rotation in spring training in 1997. He turned in a solid season, going 12-13 with 8 complete games and a league-leading 5 shutouts, and a 3.88 ERA. In 1998, he started the year 7-10, but with a solid 3.75 ERA. On July 31st, with the Expos going nowhere and having lost all of their stars from the strike-shortened 1994 season, Perez and Mark Grudzielanek, two of their better young veterans, were sent in a trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers for four youngsters, among whom only Wilton Guerrero had played in the majors. Perez pitched well for Los Angeles, going 4-4 with two shutouts in 11 starts. He was awful in 1999 however, going 2-10 with a terrible 7.43 ERA in 16 starts, and spending some time with the AAA Albuquerque Dukes to try to right himself. To top things off, he was placed on the disabled list on September 7th, ending his season.\n Carlos Perez turned in one more season in the major leagues in 2000, but it was another huge disappointment, as he went 5-8, 5.56 in 30 games. He was earning big money by then, making him an easy target for fans' anger, especially since he had always had a wild personality, prone to fits of anger and of seeming complacency on the mound. For example, when at bat, he would almost always swing for the fences, resulting in a few spectacular home runs (he hit four over his major league career) and a smattering of extra-base hits, but also a ton of strikeouts. His antics were considered funny and refreshing when he was winning, but grated on his managers when he was no longer getting batters out. There were questions about whether his arm was seriously injured or not, or whether he was malingering and just uninterested anymore. He pitched a few games for the Las Vegas 51s in 2001, going 2-1, 6.53, but has been out of organized baseball since that time. He has continued to pitch in the winter leagues, with some degree of success. With pitching at a premium in the majors and all sorts of retreads getting chances to show they have something left in their arms, Perez could have been expected to land another job at some point, but he had seemingly burned too many bridges over the years for that to happen.\n Pérez was the worst hurler for the victorious Tigres del Licey in the 2008 Caribbean Series, allowing 3 runs in 2/3 of an inning of work."},

He did not sign, opting to attend Texas A&M instead. He was then chosen by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 2012 amateur draft with the 15th overall pick. He made his pro debut with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers on June 20th, going 3-for-4.\n Naquin made the Indians' roster out of spring training in 2016 and made his debut as a pinch-hitter on Opening Day, April 5th, against the Boston Red Sox. He started the next day in center field and collected his first career hit, a single off Clay Buchholz in the 2nd inning. He quickly took over as the team's starting center fielder with Michael Brantley missing the start of the season with an injury and he hit an excellent .341 in April. In spite of that, he was optioned twice to the minor leagues in May, as Brantley was back, playing only 8 games for Cleveland during the month. He was back to stay on June 1st and had another outstanding month, hitting .338 with 14 extra-base hits (6 doubles, 3 triples and 5 homers) to be named the American League Rookie of the Month. He was one of the main contributors as Cleveland won its last 13 games of that month. He repeated as Rookie of the Month in July after batting .348 with 14 runs, 6 homers and 15 RBIs. He had back-to-back game-ending RBIs on August 18-19; the first came on a sacrifice fly as a pinch-hitter, but the second was truly spectacular, an inside-the-park walk-off homer against the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays had entered the 9th with a 2-1 lead, but closer Roberto Osuna first coughed up a gopher ball to Jose Ramirez and Tyler followed with a drive that bounced off the top of the right-field fence out of the reach of RF Michael Saunders; CF Melvin Upton gave chase but Naquin dove head-first into home well ahead of the relay throw as Upton had fallen down while recovering the ball, losing more time. He finished his rookie season at .296, with 14 homers and 43 RBIs in 116 games, for an OPS+ of 128. He was third in the voting for the 2016 American League Rookie of the Year Award. In the postseason, he played 11 games as the Indians made it to Game 7 of the World Series, which they lost the Chicago Cubs in a heartbreaker. He was 4 for 23 (.174) with a pair of doubles and 2 RBIs.\n Tyler failed to establish himself as a regular after his strong first season. He hit just .216 in 19 games in 2017 and .264 in 61 games in 2018. He did have a decent year in 2019, with an OPS+ of 103 in 89 games while hitting .288 with 10 homers and 34 RBIs, but he fell again in 2020, to an OPS+ of 70 in 40 games, after batting .218 with 4 homers and 20 RBIs. He returned to the postseason that year, but went 1 for 8 as the Indians were eliminated by the New York Yankees in two games in the Wild Card Series. That ended his tenure in Cleveland as he became a free agent after the season and was not pursued by the Indians.\n On February 18, 2021, he moved downstate, signing with the Cincinnati Reds. He hit .270 in a career-high 127 games that year with 19 homers and 70 RBIs for his best overall season since his rookie year. His OPS+ was 107 as the team's regular centerfielder, playing alongside a duo of All-Stars in Nick Castellanos and Jesse Winker. However, both had left by the time the 2022 season started, and the Reds had a very rough first few weeks. By then, Tyler had moved to right field, taking Winker's old spot, and his production was barely adequate, with a .245 average in 55 games, 6 homers and 31 RBIs. On July 28th, he was traded to the New York Mets along with P Phillip Diehl in return for two minor leaguers, Jose Acuna and Hector Rodriguez, as the Mets wanted to add some depth for the final two months of the season."},

At that time, he had already played two seasons in the Cuban Serie Nacional, the island's top baseball league, lining up with Cienfuegos at ages 17 and 18 in 2012-13 and 2013-14. He played regularly both years, against much older competition, hitting .283/.414/.348 (13 SB, 5 CS) and .273/.365/.406. He was part of the Cuban junior national team that played in the 2011 World Youth Championship in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco, Mexico and the 2013 World Junior Championship held in Taichung, Taiwan. He made the tournament All-Star team at third base in the first competition after hitting .500/.643/.800 with 9 runs scored as Cuba finished in second place. In the latter event, he batted .375/.483/.582 and led Cuba in average, OBP and slugging. He was 0 for 2 with two walks for Cuba in the 2013 World Port Tournament.\n Contrary to other recent defectors, Moncada's departure did not involve a daring night-time escape; he in fact received permission from authorities to get out in order to seek professional opportunities elsewhere, a sign that the long-time state policy of \"locking up\" promising players on the island was beginning to erode. Given his impressive accomplishments at a very young age, he was much sought-after after he defected, and on February 23, 2015, the Boston Red Sox secured his services by out-bidding several other major league teams who saw him work out in Guatemala, offering a signing bonus of $31.5 million. The Red Sox, who were already over their allotted international bonus pool allotment, incurred a 100% penalty on the bonus money offered, but they felt that it was worth it because Moncada was a truly exceptional talent.\n Moncada began his professional career in 2015 with the Greenville Drive of the South Atlantic League. In 81 games as the team's primary second baseman, he hit .278/.380/.438, with 19 doubles and 8 homers, 61 runs scored and 38 RBIs. He also stole 49 bases while being caught only 3 times. He was rated the Red Sox's number 1 prospect by mlb.com and voted the organization's Minor League Player of the Year. He led Red Sox farmhands in swipes (10 over Manuel Margot) and was 3rd in the SAL (behind Jorge Mateo and Johneshaw Fargas). He also got better as the season progressed and as he adjusted to a new life in the United States, making the organization optimistic that while already a solid player, he was only beginning to tap his true potential. Another sign of how highly regarded he was at that early point, he was featured on the cover of Baseball America that October. The publication ranked him as the SAL's top prospect that year.\n Moncada was named to the World team in the 2016 Futures Game and ended up winning the Larry Doby Award as the game's MVP. He made a nice play to throw out Andrew Benintendi in the 3rd, singled and stole second in the 4th, moving to third on an errant throw by C Chance Sisco, then in the 8th hit a two-run homer off Anthony Banda to put the World team ahead, 4-3; they would end up 11-3 winners after a seven-run 9th inning. As soon as rosters expanded on September 1, 2016, the Red Sox announced that he was being called up to Boston to give the team a hand during the stretch run. He was hitting .255 with 11 homers in 45 games for the AA Portland Sea Dogs after starting the year with the Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League, where he had hit .307 in 62 games. Between the two stops, his batting line was .294/.407/.511 in 106 games, with 31 doubles, 6 triples, 15 homers, 94 runs scored and 62 RBIs. That performance led to his being named the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year for 2016. He made his debut with the Red Sox on September 2nd, coming into the game as a substitute and going 0 for 1 with a walk, a run and a strikeout in a 16-2 win over the Oakland Athletics. He played 8 games, going 4 for 19 (.211) with 3 runs and 1 RBI. He struck out in his final 9 plate appearances of the year, one shy of the all-time record for a position player, held by Rick Ankiel.\n It appeared that Moncada was on course to be the Red Sox's starting third baseman in 2017, especially after Boston traded away the incumbent at the position, Travis Shaw, early on December 6th, but later that day, he was traded as well, being the central element in a package of four prospects that landed ace pitcher Chris Sale from the Chicago White Sox. Accompanying Yoan to the Windy City were Luis Alexander Basabe, Victor Diaz and Michael Kopech. He was assigned to the Charlotte Knights where in 80 games, he hit .282 with 12 homers and 36 RBIs and returned to the Futures Game in 2017, again as part of the Word team. On July 18th, the White Sox traded starting 3B Todd Frazier to the New York Yankees and Yoán was immediately called up to take his place, making his debut on July 19th. He went 0 for 2 with a walk in his first game, a 9-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He hit his first big league homer on July 26th, a solo shot off Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs, but on July 31st, he collided in the outfield with fellow rookie Willy Garcia, his knee banging hard on his teammate's head as both were trying to catch a ball in shallow right field. He had to be carted off the field. He only missed a couple of games, though, and was back starting at second base on August 3rd. On August 25th, however, he was placed on the disabled list with a bone contusion on his right shin. He was hitting .188 with 3 homers and 11 RBIs in 30 games. He returned to action on September 5th. On September 14th, he had a spectacular game as he scored five times from four hits - including a homer - and two walks in a 17-7 win over the Detroit Tigers. He had a chance to reach base seven times, but struck out in the 9th inning. He finished the year at .231 in 54 games, with 8 homers and 22 RBIs.\n In 2018, he was the regular second baseman all season, but had a disappointing season, as he hit just .237 in 139 games and led the American League with 217 strikeouts. He did show decent power, though, with 32 doubles, 6 triples and 17 homers, although, proportionally, this was similar than what he had hit the previous year. He scored 73 runs and drove in 61, and his OPS+ was 93 after reaching 103 as a rookie. As a result, he was dismissed as a bit of a bust as heading into 2019, reporters focused on the next big things about to join the White Sox, namely OFs Eloy Jimenez and Luis Robert. Jimenez had a great rookie season and Robert was the Minor League Player of the Year, but Moncada also had a breakout season after moving to a less demanding defensive position, third base. In 132 games, he batted .315 with 34 doubles, 5 triples and 25 homers, scored 83 runs and drove in 79, and cut his strikeouts to 154. The only negative was a drop in his walk rate, but his OBP was still an excellent .367, and his OPS+ a sparkling 141. He was finally the player that his minor league results had promised he would be - it had just taken him a couple of seasons to reach his potential.\n On March 5, 2020, the White Sox signed him to a contract extension for five years and $70 million, with an option for a sixth year. That deal followed on the heels of those signed by Jimenez and Robert earlier that off-season, as the White Sox were consolidating the core of what they hoped would be their next championship team. But only a week later, the season was put on hold by the Coronavirus pandemic, and by the time training camp resumed on July 1st, Yoán was missing in action, having tested positive for the virus prior to rejoining the team one of a number of such positive tests around MLB. He had to wait things out at home before he was cleared to make it to Chicago on July 16th, after two consecutive negative tests. But with the season opener only a week away, it was not clear if he would be ready to go at that point, given the extended time he had missed.\n Moncada is a big music fan, trying his hand at both signing and composing as a hobby. One of his efforts was noticed by Cuban singer Lenier through social, and he helped Yoán put together his first record. The song \"Desastre Personal\", featuring Moncada, Lenier and another Latin star, El Chacal, was released as a single in February 2021, accompanied by a music video."},

He hit .509 with 14 homers as a high school junior; on the mound, he was 10-3 with 3 saves, a 1.26 ERA and 160 strikeouts in 100 innings. He was All-State for Indiana. In 2005, the senior went 16-0 with 2 saves and a 0.71 ERA and batted .400 with 14 long balls. Baseball America named him as a third-team All-American high school utility man, behind first-teamers Colby Rasmus and Zach Putnam and second-teamers Buster Posey and Jordan Schafer. He was All-State, won the Gatorade Player of the Year award for Indiana, and was the recipient of the Indiana Mr. Baseball Award. His school became the second in Indiana history to go unbeaten, following one led by Don Mattingly in the 1970s. Overall, he had gone 39-4 with a 1.10 ERA and 455 strikeouts in 288 IP in high school and batted .479 with 92 RBI. The Seattle Mariners took him in the 6th round of the 2005 amateur draft but he decided to go on to college.\n Lynn was 7-3 as a freshman at the University of Mississippi in 2006. In 2007, the big sophomore set an Ole Miss strikeout record by whiffing 146 in 123 1/3 innings. He went 8-5 with a 2.85 ERA. Lynn was 5th in the Southeastern Conference in ERA, second to David Price in strikeouts and third in opponent average (.209). Lynn was 5th in NCAA Division I in strikeouts, trailing Price, Brian Matusz, Wes Roemer and Preston Guilmet. \n Lynn was chosen for Team USA's college edition. He was 2-1 with a 1.80 ERA on the summer, allowing only 12 hits in 25 innings. In the 2007 Pan American Games, he allowed 5 hits and 3 runs in 7 innings in his lone start, a 8-4 win over Nicaragua. The USA won Silver in the event. Lynn left the team partway through the summer due to fatigue concerns and missed the 2007 World Port Tournament.\n Lynn was taken by the St. Louis Cardinals with the 39th pick of the 2008 amateur draft; the pick was compensation for the loss of Troy Percival to free agency. He was signed by scout Jay Catalano and made his pro debut with the Batavia Muckdogs on June 21 and worked two innings against the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, walking one and striking out one while allowing no hits or runs.\n Lynn was called up to the majors on June 2, 2011 to make an emergency start for the Cardinals. Working on short rest, he was very efficient, needing only 52 pitches to get through the first five innings, but got in trouble in the 6th. He left having given up 5 runs on 4 hits and a hit batsman in 5 1/3 innings and was charged with his team's 12-7 loss to the San Francisco Giants; one of the hits he gave up was the first of three homers Aubrey Huff would hit that day. Teammate Maikel Cleto also made his major league debut in that game. Lynn made 18 appearances for the Cardinals in 2011, including 2 starts, putting up a 3.12 ERA while giving up only 25 hits in 34 2/3 innings, and striking out 40. His record was 1-1, with a save. He was a key man out of the bullpen during the Cards' surprising run to a World Series title, making 10 relief appearances in the postseason. He won Game 2 of the NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, and Game 3 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers. He had one of his rare difficult outings in Game 6, when he gave up 3 runs on a pair of homers - to Adrian Beltre and Nelson Cruz - in an inning and two-thirds; that placed the Cardinals in a 7-4 hole with 3 innings left to play, but the Cardinals mounted a remarkable comeback, staving elimination and sparing him the loss. He pitched 11 innings overall, with a 3.27 ERA during the postseason.\n In 2012, following the departure of Edwin Jackson via free agency, he was moved to the starting rotation. He made the Cards' brass appear like geniuses when he won his first four starts in emphatic fashion by giving up only 4 earned runs and 16 hits over his first 27 innings. On May 7th, he was at 6-0 with a 1.48 ERA. On June 13th, he became the second 10-game winner in the major leagues, moments after R.A. Dickey of the Mets. That win was another gem, a 1-0 combined shutout of the Chicago White Sox during which he matched a career high with 12 strikeouts. That brought his record to 10-2, 2.42, with over one strikeout per inning. He made the All-Star team (but did not play in the All-Star Game), but was noticeably less effective in the second half, finishing the year at 18-7, 3.78 after spending some time in the bullpen, which is where he was placed for the postseason. He was 4th in the National League in wins, between Johnny Cueto and Cole Hamels. He was also among the leaders in strikeouts per 9 innings (9.2, behind Gio Gonzalez and Jeff Samardzija) as well as tying Carlos Zambrano for fifth in hit batsmen (10). He did lead the Cardinals in wins, however, then won Game 2 of the NLDS against the Washington Nationals when he relieved an injured Jaime Garcia and pitched 3 innings in a 12-4 win. He was charged with the Cards' loss in Game 4, also in relief, then moved back to the starting rotation in the NLCS, when it turned out that Garcia's injury was of the season-ending variety. He gave up 4 runs in 3 2/3 innings in Game 1, but St. Louis still managed to beat the San Francisco Giants, 6-4, then gave up another 4 runs in as many innings in Game 5, and this time was charged with the 5-0 loss.\n In 2013, he started the season in dominant form for the second straight year. On May 1st, he improved to 5-0 in beating the Cincinnati Reds, 4-2. It was his 10th straight win in the regular season, dating back to 2012. He was the first pitcher to five wins in the National League and had an ERA of 2.75 in 36 innings. He went 15-10 in 33 starts during the season, putting up a 3.97 ERA in 201 2/3 innings. In spite of being a workhorse started during the season, and finishing 6th in the NL in wins, he was on the bubble for the Cardinals' starting rotation during the postseason. He was hit hard in a 7-1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 2 of the NLDS, but then was a winner in extra innings in a relief appearance in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers on October 11th. He came in the top of the 12th with the score tied at 2-2, and put a couple of runners on but was bailed out by a double play grounder; he then pitched a perfect 13th inning and got the W when Carlos Beltran drove in Daniel Descalso with the winning run in the bottom of the inning. He later started Game 4 and pitched into the 6th inning, giving up a pair of runs, to earn a 4-2 win. In the World Series, he lost Game 4, 4-2, when he gave up 3 runs in 5 2/3 innings against the Boston Red Sox, then relieved a struggling Michael Wacha with two outs in the 4th in Game 6. However, he gave up a pair of singles and a walk without retiring anyone, and the Sox's lead had increased from 4-0 to an insurmountable 6-0 before Seth Maness got the last out.\n Lynn won his first four starts of the season in 2014 to improve to 12-0 lifetime during March and April. The winning streak ended on April 24th when he was charged with a 4-1 loss to the New York Mets in spite of allowing only 2 earned runs in 6 1/3 innings. On May 27th, he pitched the first complete game of his career when he hurled a 6-0 shutout over the New York Yankees at home to improve to 6-2 on the year. On June 13th, he came out on top of a great pitchers' duel with Jordan Zimmermann of the Washington Nationals, holding his opponents scoreless over 8 innings as the Cards won, 1-0, on a solo homer by Matt Adams in a game in which there were only 5 hits. For the second straight season, he finished the year with a record of 15-10, and his ERA was down by more than a full run, to 2.74. He made a pair of starts in the postseason but was involved in the decision in neither, as he allowed 4 runs in 11 2/3 innings. In 2015, his record was only 12-11, even though his ERA was solid once again, at 3.03 and the Cardinals put up the best record in the major leagues. Pitching through pain for a good part of the year, he only logged 175 1/3 innings in 31 starts, after topping 200 the previous two seasons. He was passed over in the Cards' starting rotation against the Chicago Cubs in the NLDS and was only used for an inning of relief in which he gave up a run as the Cardinals were upset.\n Lynn underwent Tommy John surgery following the 2015 postseason, putting him out for all of 2016. He came back in 2017 to make a National League-leading 33 starts, ending up 11-8, 3.43 while logging 186 1/3 and striking out 153 batters. He became a free agent after the season and while his numbers should have made him a hot property, he was caught in the glacial market affecting free agents that winter. He only signed on March 10, 2018 when he agreed to a one-year deal with the Minnesota Twins for $12 million. Results with Minnesota weer not that great, as in 20 starts he went 7-8 with a 5.10 ERA. Meanwhile, the team as a whole disappointed and it soon became clear that there was little chance of returning to the postseason that year. As the trading deadline approached, the Twins dealt a number of veterans including Lynn who was sent to the New York Yankees on July 30th in return for 1B Tyler Austin and P Luis Rijo. With the Yankees, he was expected to be used as a long reliever and serve as an insurance policy if a starter went down to injury. His first outing came in relief, but he was quickly tagged to replace an ineffective Sonny Gray in the rotation. His first start on August 6th was outstanding as he held the Chicago White Sox scoreless into the 8th inning in a 7-0 Yankees win. He retired 19 straight batters at one point. he went 3-2, 4.14 in 11 games - 9 starts - for the Yankees, then was used out of the bullpen in the postseason. He had a good outing in Game 1 of the Division Series, when he pitched 2 scoreless innings in relief of J.A. Happ and Chad Green in a 5-4 loss to the Boston Red Sox, but in the pivotal Game 3, things went sour as he replaced a shaky Luis Severino in the 4th inning, as he had allowed the first three batters of the inning tor each base, loading the bases with New York already down 3-0. Lance could not pull off a miracle however; he walked the first man he faced, Mookie Betts, to force in a run, than allowed a bases-clearing double to the next batter, Andrew Benintendi. By the time the inning ended, Green had replaced him on the mound and the Yankees were down, 10-0, on their way to losing the game 16-1. They never recovered from that beating.\n Lynn became a free agent after the 2018 season. On December 12th, he signed a three-year contract with the Texas Rangers worth $30 million. It unexpectedly turned out to be one of the best signings of the off-season as Lynn had a great first half in 2019, going 11-4, 3.91 in 18 starts. He then had his best game of the year in his first start after the All-Star break, on July 11th, as he defeated the Houston Astros, 5-0, striking out 11 batters in 7 innings. His 12th win made him the major league leader in the category, and his performance was one of the major reasons the Rangers were in the thick of the race for a wild card slot. He finished the year at 16-11, 3.67 in 33 starts and 208 1/3 innings, striking out 246 batters. He had another good year during the abbreviated 2020 season, as he went 6-3, 3.32 in a league-leading 13 starts, also leading the American League with 84 innings pitched and striking out 85 batters. His name had circulated at the trading deadline in both 2019 and 2020 but no deal was consummated those two years. However, on December 7, 2020, a taker was found as the Chicago White Sox agreed to give up two top pitching prospects, Dane Dunning and Avery Weems, to acquire Lance.\n On April 8, 2021, he pitched the first shutout of the major league season in a 6-0 win over the Kansas City Royals; he allowed just 5 hits, walked none and struck out 11 opponents in a great performance. It was a harbinger of things to come, as he had a great first half, going 9-3, 1.99 in 16 starts. This got him his second invitation to the All-Star Game, 9 years after his first appearance back in 2012. He pitched one scoreless inning in the game played at Coors Field, then three days afterwards, the White Sox announced that he had been signed to a two-year extension worth $38 million. In Chicago, he was reunited with his first big league manager, Tony LaRussa, who had come out of retirement to lead the Pale Hose. On August 18th, he threw a tantrum at umpire Nic Lentz after he asked to see the pitcher's equipment as part of one the routine checks being performed on pitchers since June; Lynn had gone from the mound to the dugout at the end of the inning, without stopping for the check-up, and reacted by throwing his belt at the umpire, which resulted in his being ejected from the game. Late in the season, he dealt woth some inflammation in his right knee, missing two weeks of action in early September. He finished the season at 11-6, 2.69 in 28 starts, with 176 strikeouts in 157 innings. He was then tabbed to start Game 1 of the Division Series against the Houston Astros on October 7th, but things did not go well as he allowed 5 runs on 6 hits and 2 walks in 3 2/3 innings and was charged with his team's 6-1 loss.\n Just before the start of the 2022 season, on April 3rd, the White Sox got some bad news as he was diagnosed with a torn tendon in his right knee, requiring surgery, an injury related to the one that had cost him a couple of weeks of action the previous season. He was expected not to do any throwing for four weeks, and then would need to work himself back into game shape, so a long absence was in the cards. He made his first start of the season on June 13th, but did not miss a turn the rest of the way, ending up with 21 starts and a record of 8-7, 3.99. On June 18, 2023, he tied a White Sox team record set by Jack Harshman back on July 25, 1954 by striking out 16 batters in a start against the Seattle Mariners. In spite of all the whiffs, he was charged with a 5-1 loss, reflecting a year in which he struggled more often than not: after 15 starts, his record was 4-8, 6.51. On July 28th, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Joe Kelly in return for OF Trayce Thompson and minor leaguers Jordan Leasure and Nick Nastrini. The White Sox were cleaning house in terms of veteran pitchers, having traded away Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo López two days earlier, and Kendall Graveman the same day. He found new life on the West Coast as it took him just 9 starts to match his total of wins with Chicago - 6. He had also cut almost two full runs from his ERA, going from 6.47 with the Sox to 4.67 with the Dodgers."},

He played relatively little in his first two seasons with the Golden Bears, but as a junior in 2019, he hit 15 homers and drove in 57 runs in 51 games while batting .337 to establish himself as a dangerous hitter. He had compensated for his lack of college action by playing regularly in the Northwoods League, a summer collegiate league, in both 2017 and 2018, and doing well in both of his seasons with the La Crosse Loggers. In his school, he had an unusual second sport besides baseball - water-polo.\n He began his professional career in 2019 with the Tri-City ValleyCats of the New York-Penn League where in 64 games, he hit .268/.359/.371. After being forced to sit out the 2020 season because the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the minor leagues, he had another good year in 2021 when he rose all the way from High-A to Double-A to Triple-A in just one season. He started off with the Asheville Tourists, was promoted to the Corpus Christi Hooks after 29 games, and ened up with the Sugar Land Skeeters, reaching the level in mid-September. Overall, he hit .277/.340/.438 in 88 games, along with 18 doubles and 11 homers. To finish things off in that busy year, he was sent to the Arizona Fall League after the season ended.\n In 2022, he spent most of the season with the Sugar Land Space Cowboys (as the team was now known), hitting .238 in 104 games, with 25 homers and 76 RBIs. He made his major league debut on July 1st, and hit .160 in 12 games. He was activated late in the postseason but did not appear in any games of the 2022 World Series in which the Astros defeated the Philadelphia Phillies. In 2023, he was back in AAA, hitting .283 in 68 games, although his power fell significantly, with just 5 homers. On July 28th, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in return for P Kendall Graveman."},

The scout was Tim Collinsworth. Kopech had fanned 129 in 64 IP as a high school senior, going 3-0 with a 0.44 ERA. His signing bonus was $1.678 million.\n He pitched for the GCL Red Sox in 2014, going 0-1 with 16 strikeouts and a 4.72 ERA in 13 1/3 innings. In 2015, he was 4-5 with 70 strikeouts and a 2.63 ERA in 65 innings for the Greenville Drive. Going into 2016, he was ranked the #89 prospect in minor league baseball and the #5 prospect in the Red Sox system by Baseball America. Baseball America said he had the best fastball in both the South Atlantic League and the Red Sox chain and the best slider in the Red Sox chain. He was suspended for part of the 2016 season for testing positive for a banned stimulant and also missed some time with a broken following an altercation with his roommate in spring training. He made one start with the Lowell Spinners and 11 with the Salem Red Sox that year. Combined, he was 4-1, 2.08, pitching 56 1/3 innings and striking out 86 while walking 33.\n On December 6, 2016, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with Yoan Moncada, Luis Alexander Basabe and Victor Diaz in return for ace starter Chris Sale. He was named to the United States team for the 2017 Futures Game. he went 9-8, 2.88 in 25 starts between the AA Birmingham Barons and AAA Charlotte Knights that season. He struck out 172 batters in 134 1/3 innings and was the Southern League Pitcher of the Year. He started 2018 back at Charlotte and was 7-7, 3.70 after 24 starts when the White Sox announced that he would be making his major league debut on August 21st in a start against the Minnesota Twins. He was still overpowering minor league hitters at that point, with 170 strikeouts in 126 1/3 innings, against just 100 hits allowed. It was clearly time for him to show what he could do against major leaguers. In his first start, he pitched 2 scoreless innings, striking out 4, then a 52-minute rain delay meant that he wasn't able to come back for the 3rd. Luis Avilan relieved him. Shortly thereafter, he became the latest player to have his youthful indiscretions on social media catch up with him, as stupid messages dating back to 2013 were unearthed. He quickly deleted these and apologized. He recorded his first career win on August 26th, 7-2 over the Detroit Tigers. However, on September 5th, he had trouble getting loose before a start and after struggling during the game, allowing 7 runs in 3 1/3 innings aginst the Detroit Tigers, he was diagnosed with an elbow injury of the type that would require him to undergo Tommy John surgery. He had gone 1-1, 5.02 in 4 starts. \n He missed all of 2019 as a result of the surgery but seemed set to return in 2020 until he decided to sit out the season on July 10th. While he did not make a public announcements like some other players had done, it was assumed his decision was taken out of health and safety concerns. He had been absent from training camp for what had been called personal reasons. It turned out that he was in the middle of divorcing his wife, actress Vanessa Morgan, after only six months, and only days after Morgan announced she was pregnant. He did return in 2021 and was outstanding at the start of the season, striking out 27 batters in his first 15 2/3 innings, to go along with a 1.72 ERA in his first 7 appearances. He was used mainly as a reliever, making 4 starts in his 44 appearances, and going 4-3, 3.50 with 103 strikeouts in 69 1/3 innings. He pitched twice in the Division Series against the Houston Astros, and in 3 innings was banged around, allowing 6 runs on 7 hits and a walk, even if he did strike out 5 batters.\n In 2022, he was moved back to the starting rotation and over his first 8 starts, while his record was only 1-1, it came with a splendid 1.29 ERA, 17 hits allowed in 42 innings, and 39 strikeouts. In two consecutive starts against the New York Yankees on May 15th and May 22nd, he retired 30 straight batters, three more than are needed to record a perfect game: the last 13 in a 5-1 loss in the first game, and the first 17 in the second. He recorded his first win of the year in that game, but almost ended up with yet another no-decision, as his teammates finally scored their runs in the top of the 8th, after he had clearly expended all of the pitches he had in him that day: he had issued his only two walks of the evening with two outs in the 7th with the game still scoreless before reaching back to strike out Estevan Florial to end the frame. It was clear that manager Tony LaRussa would have taken him out of the game had he failed to retire Florial. He ended up making 25 starts during the season, going 5-9, 3.54 and striking out 105 batters in 119 1/3 innings. However, he had to leave a game on June 12th with discomfort in his right knee, and it was a lingering issue for the remainder of the year. He made a couple of stays on the injured list, in August and September and had an operation on the knee after the season.\n In 2023, he started the year slowly as he was just 1-4, 5.74  after his first 8 starts, having gone winless in April. On May 19th, however, he pitched a gem against the Kansas City Royals as he retired the first 16 Royals batters he faced before allowing a single to Michael Massey in the 6th, then did not allow anything else as he completed 8 innings, striking out 10. Kendall Graveman followed with a perfect 9th inning to complete the combined one-hitter for a 2-0 win.\n His fastball has been timed regularly at 101 mph and as high as 105 mph in a minor league game, which explains why he is such a highly-regarded prospect in spite of limited experience."},

The scouts were Carlos Reyes, Jose Serra and Louie Eljaua. He began his professional career that season with the AZL Cubs, playing 42 games and hitting .227 with 3 homers and 27 RBIs. In 2015, he moved up to the Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League, where he was a full three years younger than the average player in the circuit. He hit .284/.328/.418 in 57 games, with 10 doubles and 7 homers.\n While his first couple of seasons had been impressive given his young age, he had a true breakout year in 2016, when he was assigned to the South Bend Cubs of the Midwest League. After 80 games, he was hitting .332 with 29 doubles and 10 homers, earning him a spot on the World team for the 2016 Futures Game, played on July 10th at Petco Park in San Diego, CA.  He had a great game, driving in his team's first run with a double in the 6th, then, playing RF, making a tremendous catch over the right field railing on a foul ball hit by Dylan Cozens in the 7th. He capped it off by hitting a long three-run homer off Ryne Stanek in the 9th that was part of a seven-run inning that completed an 11-3 win by the World team. He returned to the Futures Game in 2017, again as a member of the World team. Less than a week after that game, on July 13th, the Cubs sent Jimenez, along with fellow prospects Dylan Cease, Matt Rose and Bryant Flete, to the Chicago White Sox in return for P Jose Quintana. Injuries limited him to 89 games spread among three teams in Class A and AA that season, and his final numbers were .312/.379/.568 with 22 doubles and 19 homers.\n In 2018, the White Sox had him start the season in AA with the Birmingham Barons, then after 53 games moved up to AAA for the first time with the Charlotte Knights. Combined, he hit .337/.384/.577 in 108 games, with 28 doubles, 22 homers and 73 RBIs. Mindful of not hastening his future eligibility for arbitration, the White Sox did not call him up at the end of the year, although he had done everything to earn such an opportunity, along the lines of how the Toronto Blue Jays had handled another super-prospect, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. In fact, these two and Fernando Tatis Jr. were the consensus top three prospects in baseball heading into the 2019 season, with all three expected to start the year in the minors but to make their debut before the end of the first half. Jimenez was obviously his team's main focus of reporters in spring training, as White Sox fans had been waiting for years for a player of his talent to join the squad. He was sent to the minor league camp relatively early, on March 12th, but on March 20th, the White Sox offered him a six-year contract worth $43 million, to ensure he would be kept on board through his years of arbitration eligibility. The issue of eligibility arbitration out of the way, the White Sox turned around and brought Eloy back to the major league team, taking advantage of an injury to veteran Jon Jay to announce that Jimenez would be the opening day left fielder. \n He made his debut on March 28, 2019, going 0 for 3 with a runs scored and an RBI in a 5-3 loss to the Kansas City Royals. His first two major league homers came on the same day, April 12th, in a 9-6 win over the New York Yankees; the first came off Jonathan Holder in the 5th and the second off Chad Green in the 7th.  On April 27th, he went on the injured list after getting his foot caught in the padding of the outfield fence while trying to make a leaping grab. The resulting ankle sprain made him miss over three weeks of action. He was hitting .241 at the time of the injury, then went in a slump after his return, as he saw his average fall to  .205 on May 29th. He then began to raise it slowly but steadily, as he hit .284 with 8 homers and 20 RBIs in a very solid month of June. On July 16th, however, he suffered another injury caused by a collision in the outfield, this one with CF Charlie Tilson. He was placed again on the injured list, this time with nerve contusion in his right arm. He was reactivated on July 28th and finished the year strong as he was named the American League Rookie of the Month in September when he hit .340 with 9 homers and 25 RBIs in 24 games. He ended the season at .267 with 31 homers and 79 RBIs in 122 games, with an OPS+ of 117 for an excellent rookie season.\n He had another solid year in 2020 as he appeared in 55 of the 60 games the White Sox played in a season shortened by the Coronavirus pandemic. He hit .296 with 14 homers and 41 RBIs, good for an OPS+ of 138. He was named the winner of a Silver Slugger Award as one of the three best-hitting outfielders in the American League. The White Sox had a breakout season, reaching the postseason for the first time since 2008. In the Wild Card Series against the Oakland Athletics, he went 1 for 2 with a double as he appeared in just one of the three games. He had suffered a foot sprain on September 24th and missed the final three games of the year and was unable to play until Game 3, and then aggravated the injury on his 3rd-inning double and had to be replaced by a pinch-runner. The injury bug hit him again in 2021, as with one week to go before opening day, he ruptured his left pectoral tendon trying to make a catch in the outfield on March 25th. The initial prognosis was that he would miss five to six months. He beat that by making it back on July 26th. After a slow first week, he caught fire with back-to-back two-homer games against the Cubs and Minnesota Twins on August 8-9. He also collected 10 RBIs during the two games."},

He went 2-1, 1.07 in 9 games for the Princeton Rays of the Appalachian League that first season. He split 2015 between the Bowling Green Hot Rods and the Charlotte Stone Crabs, going a combined 9-6, 3.18 in 24 games. He struck out 129 batters in 130 1/3 innings. He started 2016 back with Charlotte before getting a mid-year promotion to the Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. In 20 starts, he was 7-3, 2.34 in 115 1/3 innings, picking up 117 strikeouts. In 2017, he made two starts at Montgomery, going 1-1, 2.08, then was promoted to AAA with the Durham Bulls of the International League. That was when he was selected for the United States team in the annual Futures Game, played at Marlins Park on July 9th. He got the start and impressed with two solid innings during which he gave up just one hit and struck out four. By the time Michael Kopech replaced him on the mound, he had a 3-0 lead and was credited with the 7-6 win in addition to being named the game's MVP. On September 19th, he had another great performance on a big stage, as he won the Triple-A National Championship Game against the Memphis Redbirds, representing the Pacific Coast League. The win came in a rare relief outing, as he pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings in the 5-3 win by Durham. He had gone a combined 13-9, 3.49 in 26 games between Montgomery and Durham with 172 Ks in 136 2/3 innings.\n In one of his first pitching workouts of spring training on February 22, 2018, he suffered a right forearm strain. It was quickly confirmed that he had a torn ulnar collateral nerve and that Tommy John surgery would be required, wiping out his season. In June of 2019, he was rehabilitating at the Rays' minor league complex in Port Charlotte, FL when he broke a bone in his right elbow during a bullpen session, wiping out that entire season as well as he had to undergo another round of surgery. He was then a victim of the Coronavirus pandemic, which wiped out the 2020 minor league season, although he was at the Rays' secondary training site and was on their postseason player list, even if he was never activated. Thus, he had not pitched competitively for three and a half years when he finally took part in a game in spring training with the Rays on March 22, 2021, pitching one inning against the Boston Red Sox in a Grapefruit League game. He made his long-delayed big league debut as the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on April 11th. Used as an opener, he retired all six batters he faced in a very impressive performance before turning the ball over to Michael Wacha.\n Honeywell has a fastball in the upper 90's in addition to a solid curve ball. He also throws an occasional screwball, which is such a rare pitch coming from a righthander that it leaves batters completely baffled. His father, also named Brent Honeywell, pitched in the minors from 1988 to 1990 and was a cousin of Mike Marshall. The younger Honeywell's screwball was taught him by Marshall, although he did not adopt some of the PhD's more unorthodox pitching advice."},

He went 4-2 with a 2.05 ERA, struck out 52 in 44 innings and walked 11. He made his Claxton Shield debut in 2008 and went 3-0 with a 1.90 ERA, finishing third in ERA and tying Tim Cox and Mark Kelly for the most wins. He struck out 25 to tie Kelly for the lead. He was added to the Australian national team for the 2008 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament and was arguably their top hurler, allowing one unearned run in five innings. He allowed two hits and a walk while fanning six. The rest of the staff was less successful (a 5.34 team ERA) and Australia failed to qualify for the Beijing Games.\n Hendriks had back surgery that prevented him from pitching in the minors in 2008, but he made Australia's roster for the 2009 World Baseball Classic. The youngest Australian player in the Classic, he was 7th among their 13 pitchers in ERA despite having an ERA over 9; Australia played their games in high-scoring Foro Sol Stadium. Hendriks tossed 1 1/3 scoreless innings in a 17-7 win over host Mexico. In his second outing, he replaced Brendan Wise in the 4th inning against Mexico, trailing 5-0 and with two aboard.

In 2012, he shuffled a number of times between AAA Rochester and the Twins' starting rotation. However, his first major league victory proved to be elusive. In a particularly heart-breaking loss on August 27th, he matched the great Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners pitch for pitch for seven innings, only to give up a solo homer to Eric Thames in the 8th. It was the only run of the game, and the complete game loss gave him a record of 0-7, 6.02 in 10 starts. He finally got his first win on September 19th, 6-4 over the Cleveland Indians, but his was his lone W of the year. He ended the season at 1-8, 5.59 in 16 starts. 2013 was more of the same, as he was 1-3, 6.85 in 10 games for the Twins. He also had a losing record in the minors, finishing the year 4-8, 4.67 in 16 starts at Rochester.\n Liam signed with the Toronto Blue Jays before the 2014 season and began the season back in AAA, this time with the Buffalo Bisons. He was 5-0, 1.48 after 9 appearances when he got the call to Toronto, replacing Esmil Rogers, who was released. This time, he was able to enter the win column quickly, as he was a winner in his first start on May 23rd, 3-2 over the Oakland A's. He explained his recent turnaround by a deliberate attempt to be more aggressive and challenge hitters more than he had in the past. After a couple more shuttles between Buffalo and Toronto, his record was at 8-1, 2.33 in AAA, where he was a mid-season All-Star, and 1-0, 6.08 in three starts for the Blue Jays when he was traded to the Kansas City Royals on July 28th. He and C Erik Kratz headed to the Royals in return for 3B Danny Valencia. he made 6 appearances for the Royals, including 3 starts, and went 0-2, 4.66 in 19 1/3 innings. He was not on the team's postseason roster, and after the Royals lost the 2014 World Series, he was designated for assignment and traded back to Toronto on October 30th, in return for minor league catcher Santiago Nessy.\n Hendriks had his best season for the Blue Jays in 2015, making 58 appearances in relief with a record of 5-0 and a 2.92 ERA. In 64 2/3 innings, he struck out 71 and walked only 11. He pitched only a third of an inning in the ALDS, but added 4 2/3 innings in two outings in the ALCS against the Kansas City Royals, allowing 3 runs on 4 hits. On November 20th, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics in return for P Jesse Chavez. His first season with the A's in 2016 was nothing special, as he went 0-4, 3.76 in 53 games as a middle reliever. In 2017, he was one of the busiest relievers in the majors, making 70 appearances, and while he struck out 78 batters in 64 innings, the rest of his numbers were unremarkable, with a 4-2 record, no saves and an ERA of 4.22. In 2018, he missed part of the season with an injury that limited him to 25 games and 24 innings. Towards the end of the year, he found a role as the team's designated \"opener\", being used as the starting pitcher in 8 bullpen games. He went 0-1, 4.13, and the Athletics made the postseason as one of two wild card teams in the American League. In the Wild Card Game played against the New York Yankees on October 3rd, the Athletics made the controversial decision of going with a bullpen game, and Hendriks was tabbed as the starter. However, the strategy did not work, as Liam allowed 2 runs in the 1st inning before recording a walk, on a walk to leadoff batter Andrew McCutchen followed by a two-run homer by Aaron Judge. The Yankees never surrendered that early lead, winning the game, 7-2, and Hendriks was charged with the loss.\n In 2019, Hendriks became a completely different pitcher, as he decided to change his approach and simply attack the strike zone relentlessly with fastballs. It worked for him as he suddenly became one of the best relief pitchers in baseball, being selected to play in the All-Star Game for the first time. He became Oakland's closer, saving 25 games (he had registered one save in 8 major league seasons entering the year), and posting an ERA of 1.80 in 75 games. He made another couple of starts as an opener, both in May, and did not record his first save until his 35th appearance on June 22nd, but from that point forward he was manager Bob Melvin's main man in the bullpen and there was no more using him in experimental roles. In 85 innings, he allowed just 61 hits and 21 walks, while striking out a whopping 124 batters. He pitched in the postseason again, against the Tampa Bay Rays in the Wild Card Game on October 2nd. He pitched the top of the 9th with the A's trailing 5-1 and retired all three batters he faced, but his teammates were unable to mount an improbable comeback in the bottom of the innings and the A's were once again eliminated in just one game.\n In 2020, Hendriks was the A's closer from the (delayed) start of the season and was great from one end of the year to the other, going 3-1, 1.78 in 24 games, with 14 saves. He again posted more than twice as many strikeouts as hits, with 37 Ks (and just 3 walks) in 25 1/3 innings, against just 14 hits. He was named the winner of the Mariano Rivera Award as the best relief pitcher in the American League. In the postseason, he made two appearances in the Wild Card Series against the Chicago White Sox, both of them in must-win games. In Game 2, he came in in the 8th with the A's holding a 5-0 lead, but he gave a two-run homer that inning (one of the runs was charged to starter Chris Bassitt) after allowing just one the entire regular season and then in the 9th, he had to be bailed out by Jake Diekman after loading the bases with two outs; Diekman forced in a run with a walk but was able to close out the win. It seemed that Hendriks would be unavailable for the deciding Game 3 on October 1st, having needed a season-high 49 pitches in Game 2, but he came back with a very impressive outing. He was his team's 8th pitcher when he pitched the top of the 9th with a 6-4 lead. After walking lead-off man James McCann, he got down to business, striking out the next three batters - Yoan Moncada, Luis Robert and Nomar Mazara - to save the game and move Oakland to the next round. In the Division Series against the Houston Astros, he made only one appearance, but it was another great one as he pitched 3 innings in Game 3, allowing just one hit and striking out 4, to receive credit for a 9-7 win. However, it was the A's only win of the series, which they lost in four games. He became a free agent after the season.\n On January 11, 2021, news emerged that Hendriks had reached a free agent deal with the Chicago White Sox, subject to official confirmation. The agreement was reportedly for three years with an option year, with $54 million guaranteed, and the option set at $15 million. The White Sox had been one of the most active teams during a winter characterized by few deals, having earlier acquired P Lance Lynn and OF Adam Eaton in separate moves. He went 8-3, 2.54 in 69 games and led the American League with 38 saves that season. He was an All-Star for the second time and repeated as winner of the Mariano Rivera Award. The White Sox made it to the postseason and he made 3 appearances in the Division Series against the Houston Astros. He pitched a scoreless inning in both Game 2 and Game 3, but did not figure in the decision in either case, then in Game 4 on October 12th, he was brought in for the 9th inning with the White Sox already trailing 7-1 and on the brink of elimination. As is the case with many closers, pitching in a situation so different from his different role did not work, as he ended up giving three more runs in his one inning, all on a home run by José Altuve. In 2022, he had another good season as the team's closer, returning to the All-Star Game for the third time as he went 4-4, 2.81 in 58 games, with 37 saves (second in the AL behind Emmanuel Clase. However, the Sox underperformed as a team and finished out of the postseason picture.\n There was some speculation after the 2022 season that the White Sox may have been willing to trade him in return for the right package, but nothing came of it. Then on January 8, 2023, he announced on his social media account that he had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer that is usually treatable. He added that he would be starting therapy immediately. He was able to join the team for the start of spring training as he kept up his training regimen even while undergoing treatment, although it was not clear when he would be able to actually play for the Sox again. While he had to miss all of spring training and the the start of the season, he had some good news on April 20th, announcing that he was now in remission and cancer-free. He made his first pitching appearance of the season with the AAA Charlotte Knights on May 5th and was activated by the White Sox on May 29th. His first game with the Sox came the same day, giving up a pair of runs in the 8th inning of a 6-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels and was preceded by a huge ovation by the crowd at Guaranteed Rate Field. He recorded his first win on June 4th, when Jake Burger hit a walk-off grand slam in the 9th to give the Sox a 6-2 win over the Detroit Tigers; Liam had pitched the top of the inning, retiring the Tigers in order. Of course, this came on National Cancer Survivors Day. He went 2-0, 5.40 in 5 games and was named the winner of the Comeback Player of the Year Award in the American League at the end of the season and also received the Tony Conigliaro Award."},

He led the minor leagues with 103 stolen bases in 2011, and in 2012 stole his 100th base on July 2nd, after only 78 games, putting him on a pace to shatter to all-time minor league record of 145 steals set by Vince Coleman in 1983. He did indeed pass Coleman with three stolen bases on August 21st, and finished the year with 155, setting a new record for organized baseball.\n Hamilton was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 2nd round of the 2009 amateur draft out of Taylorsville (MS) High School. Scouted by Tyler Jennings, he passed up an opportunity to play wide receiver at Mississippi State University to sign with the Reds.  He started his pro career that year as a shortstop with the GCL Reds, hitting .205 in 43 games. It was in his sophomore season, with the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League in 201, that he began to show tremendous skills. He hit .318 in 69 games, scoring 61 runs, hit 10 triples and stole 48 bases while being caught only 9 times. After the season, he was ranked the #50 prospect in the minor leagues by Baseball America.\n In 2011, Hamilton moved to the Dayton Dragons of the Midwest League, where he hit .278 in 135 games, scored 99 runs and stole 103 bases while being caught only 20 times. His stolen base total was the highest in the minor leagues that year and he became the first player with 100 steals in 10 years. Part of the reason for the drop in his batting average was that he started switch-hitting that year, after being originally a right-handed batter, and it took him some time to get fully comfortable hitting from the left side. However, he really emerged as a special player in 2012, when he played for the Bakersfield Blaze of the California League. Not only did he accumulate unheard of stolen base totals there, but he also was red hot with the bat, hitting .327 with a .416 OBP over the first half, and scoring almost a run per game. He was named to play in the 2012 Futures Game that year. After 82 games, he was promoted to the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the AA Southern League, but didn't slow down, as it were, immediately adding to his total of 104 stolen bases with Bakersfield. He shattered Coleman's record by getting three steals on August 21st, walking and stealing second in the 1st inning for number 144, then reaching on a single in the 3rd. He proceeded to steal second to tie the all-time record, and then third to pass the \"Man of Steal\". He finished the year with 155 steals, the new all-time record in organized baseball, in addition to a .311 batting average, 112 runs scored, 22 doubles and 14 triples.\n Caught in a pennant race, the Reds decided not to call up Hamilton at the end of the 2012 season, but he attracted a lot of attention in spring training in 2013, even though he stood no chance of making the team. The front office had asked him to move to center field and play a year in AAA, with the hope that he would be ready to be the Reds' leadoff hitter in 2014. He hit .256/.308/.343 in 123 games for the AAA Louisville Bats, scoring 75 runs but leading the International League with 75 stolen bases. He was called up to Cincinnati when rosters expanded on September 1st and made his major league debut two days later as a pinch-runner for Ryan Ludwick in the 7th inning of a scoreless tie with the St. Louis Cardinals. He promptly stole second base and came in to score on Todd Frazier's double, for the only run in a 1-0 victory with important playoff implications. He repeated the feat the next day, again subbing for Ludwick at first base in a key situation, this time with the Reds trailing, 4-3, in the bottom of the 14th inning. He once again stole second base, beating the cannon arm of Yadier Molina, and came in to score the tying run on Zack Cozart's single. Alas, the Reds blew a chance to win the game in the 15th when Shin-Soo Choo was thrown out at home when Chris Heisey whiffed on a bunt attempt, and St. Louis won the game on Matt Adams' second extra-inning homer of the game, in the 16th. He scored another key run as a pinch-runner for Ludwick on September 7th, this time beating the cannon arm of rookie Yasiel Puig when he scored the winning run from second base on Frazier's single in the 10th inning of a 4-3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in front of a packed house at Great American Ballpark. He had once again reached second base thanks to a steal, and it was his fourth in four games (the third having come the previous day); that made the first player since 1921 to start his career in this fashion. He started his first game on September 18th, playing centerfield and batting ninth in an interleague game against the Houston Astros; it was another memorable occasion, as he reached base five times on a pair of singles, a double and two walks, scored twice and stole four bases. He became the first player of the modern era to steal four times in his first career start; his second run broke a 4-4 tie in the top of the 13th inning, and was key to the Reds' 6-5 victory. He was finally caught stealing for the first time, after being successful in his first 13 attempts, on September 25th by rookie C Juan Centeno of the New York Mets.\n Following the departure of Choo via free agency, Hamilton was the starting centerfielder and lead-off hitter for the Reds when they opened the 2014 season against the St. Louis Cardinals on March 31st. He did not do much igniting, however, as he went 0 for 4 with 4 strikeouts, never getting a chance to show his speed. It took him some time to get untracked, as after 7 games, he was hitting .091 and had yet to steal a base. He broke through on April 9th with a three-hit game, scoring twice, including once on a shallow pop-up, and stealing his first two bases of the year in leading the Reds to a 4-0 win over the Cardinals. He continued to hit better after that and on April 29th hit his first career home run, a solo shot of Jeff Samardzija of the Chicago Cubs in the 5th inning of a 3-2 win. He then got very hot in June, when he collected 36 hits, including 10 doubles, scored 18 runs and stole 14 bases; he hit .327 and, although not known for his power, slugged .500, to earn National League Rookie of the Month honors. On August 27th, he stole his 50th base of the season in a 7-5 win over the Cubs; he was the 9th player in Reds history to reach the mark, the first since Deion Sanders in 1997, and the youngest of the group. On August 31st, his 54th steal tied him with Bob Bescher who had set the Reds' rookie record in 1909. He finished with 56 steals, but only 72 runs scored, a result of a sub-par .292 on-base percentage. He ended the season with a .250 average in 152 games, 72 runs scored and 48 RBIs. His 56 steals were second in the NL to Dee Gordon, but he led the circuit by being caught stealing 23 times. A good surprise was how well he played defense in centerfield, becoming a finalist for the Gold Glove at the position with some spectacular catches, coupled with excellent range, 10 assists and only 2 errors.\n He and the Reds started the 2015 season red hot. In the team's first four games - all victories - he stole 7 bases in as many attempts, becoming the first player to collect that many stolen bases in his first four games of the season since Vince Coleman had done so for the 1987 St. Louis Cardinals, on his way to getting 109 steals. With the patient Joey Votto hitting second behind him, Hamilton explained that he now felt he could take his time to select the right pitch on which to take off for second base - a big advantage. However, things went downhill after those first few games, as Billy had all sorts of trouble reaching base, and was even moved down to the 9th spot in the line-up on occasions. The few times he did get on, he was still able to steal bases seemingly at will, however, showing a much lower caught stealing rate than in his rookie season. On June 14th, he had a personal best 5 steals in an 11-inning game against the Chicago Cubs, but it still was not enough for the Reds, who lost the game, 2-1. He was placed on the disabled list on August 20th, the result of an injury suffered two days earlier on a fielding play in the 11th inning of a game against the Kansas City Royals. He made a sliding stop on a line drive hit by Alcides Escobar, then got up and rifled a bullet to throw him out, but sprained the capsule on his right shoulder and had to be taken out of the game. He was hitting .226 with a league-leading 54 stolen bases in 107 games at the time of the injury. He returned to the line-up on September 9th, but less than a week later he felt pain again after making a couple of long throws from centerfield and came out of a game early on September 14th. He came back for a pinch-running appearance a couple of days later, but that was his last game of the season, as the Reds announced on September 21st that he would undergo shoulder surgery. He finished the season at .226/.274/.289 in 114 games, with 56 runs scored and 57 stolen bases. His OPS+ was only 55 and was a key factor in the Reds' wretched season.\n Although still not a premium offensive player in 2016, Billy was at least getting on base a bit more often at the start of the season. He missed ten days in the middle of June with a concussion, then on June 29th, in the 1st inning of a game against the Chicago Cubs, he was hit in the face by a line drive hit by Anthony Rizzo after trying to avoid a collision with LF Adam Duvall. The ball rolled for an inside-the-park homer while he had to leave the game with facial lacerations and a possible other concussion. On July 5th, he put his speed on display in the Reds' first win over the Cubs that year, as he stole three bases but also set the tone in the 1st inning when he scored from second base on a passed ball by C David Ross. Before Ross could reach the ball at the backstop, Billy had already rounded third base and P John Lackey was caught completely by surprise, not moving to cover home plate until Hamilton was halfway between third and home. He scored easily as Ross's throw went over Lackey's head. On July 17th, he scored the only run in a 1-0 win over the Milwaukee Brewers by scoring on a passed ball by Jonathan Lucroy with two outs in the 9th; he had previously reached third on a stolen base. On August 7th, he had four stolen bases on three hits and scored three runs in a 7-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. That was part of a stretch of three games in which he stole 9 bases, finally putting him ahead of his main rival for the NL crown, Jonathan Villar. He led the majors with 19 steals in August, passing the total of 50 for the third straight year; the 19 stolen bases were one more than the combined total of the five teams with the fewest steals in the majors that month. However, he played his final game on September 4th, missing the final month of the season with an injury, which allowed Villar to pass him to claim the stolen base crown. He finished the season at .260 in 119 games, with 69 runs scored and 58 steals.\n On May 24, 2017, he won a game with his speed against the Cleveland Indians when he barely managed to beat out what would have been a game-ending double play grounder against closer Cody Allen in the 9th. A video review was needed to confirm that he was safe. Zack Cozart followed with a single that barely got away from LF Michael Brantley. Billy, who was running on the play, raced all the way home behind Arismendy Alcantara, who scored from third base, to give the Reds a 4-3 win. On September 4th, he won a game in a more conventional way, hitting the first walk-off homer of his career. He connected off Josh Hader of the Milwaukee Brewers with two outs in the bottom of the 9th for his fourth homer of the year, giving Cincinnati a 5-4 win. He hit .247 with an OBP of .299, 4 homers and 38 RBIs in 139 games that season, also stealing 59 bases, his fourth straight year with at least 50. Surprisingly, however, he had never been able to lead the league in that category during the period. 2018 was a very disappointing season, however. Given yet another chance to make his mark, he played 153 games, but again failed to reach base at even a .300 clip, hitting .236/.299/.327 with 4 homers and 27 RBIs. Worse, he scored just 74 runs and his stolen base total fell to 34, as his OPS+ remained dismal at 68. Having fired long-time manager Bryan Price earlier that season and seeking a new direction, the Reds decided to cut ties with Billy after the season, not making him a contract offer on November 30th, making him a free agent.\n On December 10th, he agreed to a one-year contract worth $5.25 million with the Kansas City Royals. This was potentially a good situation for him, as he would be able to play regularly with a team in full rebuilding mode, in a larger ballpark more suited to his skill set, and be able to work on improving the areas of his game that had set him back thus far. However, he hit just .211 in 93 games in 2019 with just 12 RBIs and a relatively modest total of 18 stolen bases, the result of an OBP of just .275. The Royals placed him on waivers on August 19th and he was claimed by the Atlanta Braves, who were looking at him strictly as a pinch-runner and defensive substitute for the stretch run and the postseason. His first hit for his new team was a memorable on, on August 23rd, as it came in the 14th inning of a game against the New York Mets and drove in the winning run in a 2-1 win. He had come in as a pinch-runner in the 10th and promptly stolen a base but was left stranded; four innings later, he drove in Tyler Flowers from third base by pushing a grounder just outside the reach of 2B Joe Panik. In all, he went 11 for 41 (.268) in 26 games for Atlanta, scoring 9 runs. He made his postseason debut that year, appearing in 2 games in the Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, drawing a walk, stealing a base and scoring two runs without being charged with an at-bat.\n He became a free agent again after the 2019 season and on February 9, 2020 signed with the San Francisco Giants. However, he never appeared in a game for them and on August 2nd was traded to the New York Mets in return for minor leaguer Jordan Humphreys."},

He played in the 2013 College World Series with Mississippi State University.\n After signing with the Blue Jays, he made 10 starts for the Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League in 2013, going 1-3, 4.31 and pitching 39 2/3 innings. He started 2014 back at Lansing, making 4 starts with a 2-0 record and an ERA of 0.34; promoted to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, he went 8-4, 2.23 in 16 starts and moved up again at the end of July, to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Eastern League. He made one start for New Hampshire, winning the game, and was promoted again, this time to AA and the Buffalo Bisons of the International League where he continued to pitch well, going 3-2, 1.88 in 6 starts in August. Altogether, his combined record was 14-6, 1.83 in 27 starts, with 167 1/3 innings pitched and a K/W ratio of 115/31.\n Kendall was called up to Toronto in early September and made his debut on September 5th, in a game against the Boston Red Sox. He was called in to start the bottom of the 8th after the Jays had taken a 4-2 lead in the top of the inning. However, he allowed a single to the first batter he faced, Yoenis Cespedes, and immediately gave way to lefty Aaron Loup; Cespedes ended up scoring, as did two other runs, giving him an infinite ERA after his first major league appearance. In a statistical twist, his predecessor on the mound for the Jays had been Daniel Norris, who also made his debut by facing a single batter, although things had gone better for him as he had struck out David Ortiz to end the 7th. In five games with the Jays, he had no decisions and a 3.86 ERA in 4 2/3 innings.\n On November 28, 2014, Kendall was traded to the Oakland Athletics, alongside Brett Lawrie, Sean Nolin and Franklin Barreto, in return for 3B Josh Donaldson. While he was far from the most prominent name in the trade, he was very impressive with the A's in spring training in 2015, forcing them to consider him for a slot in the starting rotation. He was successful in landing that gig, but in his first start on April 9th, he lasted only 3 1/3 innings in losing 10-1, to the Texas Rangers. His next start was much better, as he picked up his first career win with 5 1/3 scoreless innings against the Houston Astros, as the A's prevailed, 4-0. He made 21 starts for Oakland, with a record of 6-9, 4.05. In 2016, he was probably the team's most reliable starter in a rotation that was decimated by injuries. On August 19th, he pitched the best game of his career, a complete game two-hit shutout in which he faced only 28 batters, one more than the minimum. The A's beat the Chicago White Sox, 9-0. he finished the year at 10-11, 4.11 in 31 starts.\n In 2017, Kendall missed a lot of time due to injuries but pitched pretty well when he was able to take the mound, ending up at 6-4, 4.19 in 19 games. That was enough to convince the A's to give the ball on Opening Day in 2018, their starting rotation having been depleted by injuries and departures (most notably, the trade of Sonny Gray in return for prospects the previous year). He gave up 5 runs in 5 inning facing the Los Angeles Angels on March 29th, ending up with a no-decision. However, he then proceeded to lose his next five starts and was 0-5, 8.89 on April 26th when the A's decided to send him down to the minor leagues. He was leading the major leagues in losses, runs allowed and hits allowed at the time. He was 2-1, 4.50 in 4 starts for Nashville but was bothered with elbow issues which ultimately led to his undergoing Tommy John surgery at the end of July. Following the season, he became a free agent, but was not in an ideal position to negotiate a deal given he would not be available until the very end of the season, if that. He did manage to find a team, though, as on December 22nd, he signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Cubs, who were willing to simply supervise his rehabilitation in 2019 in order to have him available to pitch the next two years. Indeed, he made only two appearances in the minor leagues that year, pitching 6 innings, but was released after the season, making him a free agent again.\n Graveman then joined the Seattle Mariners for 2020, and the delayed start to the season meant he was ready to pitch for the big club when the regular season started at the end of July. After a couple of starts, both losses in which he gave up 9 runs in 8 2/3 innings, he was placed on the injured list with neck spasms. It turns out they were caused by a bone tumor in his spine. He would require surgery to fix this, but in the immediate was prepared to pitch through the pain. He returned to the mound on September 4th, and, undaunted, hit 99 mph on the radar gun coming out of the bullpen in relief of Yusei Kikuchi against the Texas Rangers. The plan was to use him as a reliever for the remainder of the season. He went 1-3, 5.79 in 11 games, logging 18 2/3 innings. In 2021, he was a full-time reliever and pitched very well, going 4-0, 0.82 with 10 saves over his first 30 games. On July 27th, he was traded to the Houston Astros along with another veteran pitcher, Rafael Montero, in return for young IF Abraham Toro and veteran P Joe Smith. It was not the typical deadline deal, as Montero had just been designated for assignment, and the Mariners were in fact in competition for a postseason slot and traded for a starting pitcher the same day. He went 1-1, 3.13 in 23 games after the trade to finish at 5-1, 1.77 with 10 saves in 53 games. In his first taste of postseason play, he pitched 9 times for Houston, going 1-0, 1.64 and allowing 2 runs on 7 hits and 4 walks in 11 innings while striking out 11. This included two games against the Atlanta Braves in the 2021 World Series.\n Before the 2022, he signed a two-year contract with the Chicago White Sox, but a team that had made the postseason the previous two years sank in the standings. The first season, he went 3-4, 3.18 with 6 saves in 65 appearances as Liam Hendriks got most of the save opportunities. In 2023, he was 3-4, 3.48 in 45 games with 8 saves, as with Hendriks largely unavailable, the Sox tried a variety of pitchers in the closer role, including Graveman. With the trade deadline approaching, with the club clearly out of contention, the Sox started trading pitchers, with Graveman being sent back to the Houston Astros on July 28th, following the trade of Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo López two days before, and that of Joe Kelly and Lance Lynn the same day. Chicago received young catcher Korey Lee in return. He was 2-2, 2.42 in 23 games for Houston with no saves and a K/W ratio of 24/16 in 22 2/3 innings. He did not appear in the postseason due to right shoulder discomfort, and in January of 2024 it was announced that he would miss all of the season after undergoing surgery. The Astros had hoped that rest and rehabilitation would suffice to address the issue, but it reoccurred when he began throwing early in the new year, prompting the decision to put him under the knife."},

He began his pro career with the DSL Yankees 2, going 1-5, 2.61 in 12 starts, then in 2017 pitched for the three different teams. He was with the DSL Yankees for 3 games, then earned successive promotions to the GCL Yankees and Pulaski Yankees. Combined, he went 6-2, 3.30 in 30 games, with 85 strikeouts in 60 innings.\n In 2018, he made 8 starts for the Charleston RiverDogs of the South Atlantic League, where he was 2-4, 3.76, before earning a promotion to the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League. On August 6th, he pitched an absolute gem in the second game of a doubleheader against the Clearwater Threshers, with 7 perfect innings during which he struck out 12 opponents. Unfortunately for him, his teammates were unable to score, and Tampa lost the game when reliever Christian Morris allowed a run without giving up a hit in the 8th.\n He was named to the roster of the American League team for the 2019 Futures Game. He made his major league debut with the Yankees on August 30, 2020, starting the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Mets. He pitched 6 innings, allowed just 1 unearned run on 4 hits and no walks while striking out 6. He was not involved in the decision as the Yankees won the game, 5-2, in extra innings. He worked particularly well with veteran catcher Erik Kratz, who had been a mentor to him in AAA the year before as they were teammates with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders and again at the Yankees' alternative training site at the start of the season. In fact, García called Kratz \"Padre\". He earned comparisons to Hall of Famer Pedro Martínez for his great control and excellent change-up, and the great Pedro himself tweeted him congratulations after the game. He kept his turn in the rotation the rest of the year, making 6 starts and going 3-2, 4.98, with 33 strikeouts in 34 1/3 innings, against just 6 walks. He was impressive enough that most observers though he should be the Yankees' number three starter in the postseason, after aces Gerrit Cole and Masahiro Tanaka. That turn came up in Game 2 of the Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays on October 6th, after Cole had started the opener. However, the Yankees tried to do something cute, leaving him for only the first inning - during which he allowed a solo homer to Randy Arozarena -, before he was replaced by veteran lefty J.A. Happ in the 2nd, in the hope that the lefthanded-heavy Rays line-up would be flummoxed. It did not work, as the Yankees lost the game, 7-5, and most observers remarked that neither pitcher was put in the game in circumstances in which he could succeed. Both were also unavailable for the remainder of the series as a result of the failed strategy.\n Heading into spring training in 2021, it was widely expected that Garcia would be one of the Yankees' starter, having proved he belonged at the major league level, and with Tanaka, Happ and James Paxton all having left during the off-season. However, at the same time, Domingo German was back after what turned out to gave been a one-year suspension for domestic violence, while veteran Corey Kluber was added as a free agent and Jameson Taillon via a trade. With Cole and Jordan Montgomery as holdovers, it was Deivi who drew the short straw, and on March 26th the Yankees announced that he would start the season back in AAA."},

He was selected by the Cleveland Indians and scout Brad Tyler in the first round of the 2013 amateur draft with the fifth overall pick.  He soon agreed to terms with the Indians for a $3.5 million bonus and made his pro debut with the AZL Indians on June 25th, going 2-for-5 with a triple and a home run against the AZL Brewers. He hit .297/.362/.506 in 44 games that season.\n In 2014, Frazier was assigned to the Lake County Captains of the Midwest League, where he hit .266/.349/.411 in 120 games. He showed good power potential with 18 doubles, 6 triples and 13 homers and also scored 70 runs. In 2015, he played 133 games for the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League, hitting .285 with 36 doubles and 16 homers, 88 runs scored and 72 RBIs. He was basically doing everything that could be expected of a first-rounder by that point, and prospect watchers took note, with Baseball America putting him at #44 on its top 100 prospect list heading into 2016, and mlb.com being even more upbeat by placing hit 27th. The Indians were flush with outfield prospects however, with Tyler Naquin breaking into the everyday line-up that season, and Bradley Zimmer poised to make his big league debut. For his part, Clint was assigned to the AA Akron Rubber Ducks, hitting .276 in 89 games, with 13 homers and 48 RBIs. On July 26th, he was promoted to the AAA Columbus Clippers, but after 5 games, he was the key player in a trade with the New York Yankees on July 31st. The Indians acquired closer Andrew Miller, in return for four players, Frazier and Ps J.P. Feyereisen, Ben Heller and Justus Sheffield.\n Frazier made his debut with the Yankees on July 1, 2017, after having started the year in AAA with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. He was called up after fellow OF Dustin Fowler had suffered a season-ending injury in his first game with the Yankees two days earlier. It was an excellent game as, starting in right field and batting 9th, he went 2 for 4 with a double and a homer, off Francis Martes and Tony Sipp respectively. He scored twice and drove in a run, but the Yankees lost 7-6 to the Houston Astros. On July 8th, he hit the first walk-off homer of his career, a three-run shot off closer Corey Knebel of the Milwaukee Brewers to give the Yankees a 5-3 win. Frazier hit a solid .298 with 3 homers and 8 RBIs over his first 13 games, but GM Brian Cashman was quick to throw cold water on the notion that he had earned a permanent spot with the team: Cashman stated on July 20th that Frazier would return to AAA as soon as Aaron Hicks, who was having a career year until sidelined by an oblique injury in late June, was ready to return to the line-up. In all, Frazier played 39 games for the Yankees, hitting .231 with 4 homers and 17 RBIs.\n Heading into the 2018 season, Frazier would normally have been expected to compete for a spot on the team, and possibly as a starter, but these were made more complicated by the Yankees' off-season acquisition of Giancarlo Stanton. With Hicks, Aaron Judge, Brett Gardner and Jacoby Ellsbury all still on hand, he was looking at a very crowded outfield picture to break into. His prospects were further dimmed when he suffered a concussion after running into the outfield fence during a Grapefruit League game on February 24th. As a result of the injury, he was limited to 54 games in the minors and 15 in the majors. He did manage to hit a solid .311 with 10 homers and 21 RBIs in 48 games for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders and went 9 for 34 (.265) with the Yankees. In 2019, he failed to make the team out of spring training in spite of the fact both Hicks and Ellsbury were injured, but when Stanton joined a crowded injured list on April 1st, he was called up to the Bronx. He hit .324 in 18 games, with 6 homers and 17 RBIs, making a very strong case that he should be in the mix for regular playing time even after all the injured players returned, but on April 25th, he became the 15th member of the team to be placed on the injured list, the result of a sprained left ankle. He also showed some defensive lapses when he returned, and fell down the depth chart with Mike Tauchman and Mike Ford leap-frogging him. He ended up playing 69 games, hitting .267 with 12 homers and 38 RBIs and was left off the postseason roster.\n In 2020, he started the year on the practice squad, as the Yankees simply had too many outfielders for the number of slots available on the major league roster. However, after Stanton and Aaron Judge were both placed on the injured list in the first three weeks, he was called back and had three fabulous games starting on August 12th, going a combined 7 for 11 with 3 doubles, 2 homers and 8 RBIs. Not surprisingly, the Yankees won all three games, not a missing a beat in spite of not having their two big boppers in the line-up. Overall, he hit .267 in 39 games, with 8 homers and 26 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 150, far and away the best of his career. Still, he had to fight for playing time in the postseason as the team's big boppers were back healthy, getting just 7 at-bats as the Yankees played two series. He did get a couple of hits, including a homer off Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays in a start in Game 1 of the Division Series on October 5th. He was once again unable to find regular work in 2021, and in this case his own health issues, including vertigo and dizziness, possibly after-effects from his crash into an outfield wall in spring training of 2018. As a result, he played just 66 games, batting .186 with 5 homers and 15 RBIs. His unavailability for most of the season meant that the Yankees had to play Brett Gardner a lot more than they would have wanted, and then traded for All-Star Joey Gallo at the trading deadline. He did not appear in a game after June 30th, and on November 23rd, with a need to trim down the roster to 40 players in anticipation of the 2021 Rule V Draft, he was given his release."},

The scout was Jerry Lafferty. He made his pro debut with the GCL Phillies and did well enough (1-3, 2.92) to earn a promotion to the Williamsport Crosscutters, where he had a 2-1, 2.25 record. He began 2008 with the Lakewood BlueClaws and was 3-5 with a 5.42 ERA and .310 opponent average. He was demoted back to Williamsport, where he went 1-4 with a 4.40 ERA. He spent 2009 with Lakewood, going 2-0 with two saves and a 4.04 ERA in a new relief role. After a strong 2010 start with the BlueClaws (2-0, 1.90, 30 K in 23 2/3 IP, albeit with 15 walks), he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers and was 0-2 with a 3.66 ERA in 24 games. He allowed a .187 average for the year with 56 strikeouts in 55 2/3 IP but also with 38 walks. He played in the Arizona Fall League. \n The Nebraskan was 0-1 with 3 saves and a 3.05 ERA for the 2011 Reading Phillies, holding lefties to a .099 average (9 hits in 91 at-bats) and whiffing 83 in 65 innings. He tied Ricky Brooks for 4th in the Eastern League with 53 pitching appearances. He allowed only one earned run and struck out 14 in 11 1/3 IP for Scottsdale in the Arizona Fall League. He opened 2012 with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs and was excellent after 13 games (1-0, 5 Sv, 1 R in 15 1/3 IP, 22 K to 3 BB). \n Diekman was then called up to the big leagues along with veteran Raúl Valdés; they replaced Joe Savery and Brian Sanches on the Phillies. In his major league debut on May 15, 2012, he relieved Chad Qualls in the top of the 9th with two men in scoring position, two outs and a 3-3 tie, a pressure-filled situation if there ever was one. He came through, striking out fellow rookie Marwin Gonzalez. In the 10th, he retired Jed Lowrie on a fly then whiffed both Jose Altuve and Jordan Schafer. Diekman got the win when Hunter Pence homered in the bottom of the inning. It was his only victory of the season, but he did pitch 32 times in relief for the Phils, with a record of 1-1, 3.95 and 35 K's in 27 1/3 innings. He struggled a bit with his control,. however, as he also issued 20 walks. In 2013, he pitched 45 times out of the bullpen, logging 38 1/3 innings as he was used as lefthanded specialist. He went 1-4 with a 2.58 ERA and struck out 41 hile walking 16, the marked improvement in his walk rate being key to better results.\n On September 1, 2014, he was the second of four Phillies pitchers to combine on a 7-0 no-hitter over the Atlanta Braves. He took over for Cole Hamels who had pitched the first six innings and pitched a perfect 7th before handing the ball over to Ken Giles in the 8th, with Jonathan Papelbon completing the feat. He pitched 73 games for the Phillies that season, going 5-5 with a 3.80 ERA and 100 strikeouts in 71 innings as a set-up man for Papelbon. In 2015, like all Phillies relievers not named Papelbon, he struggled in the first half, and his record was 2-1, 5.15 after 41 games when on July 29th he and Hamels were traded to the Texas Rangers in return for P Matt Harrison and five prospects: Ps Alec Asher, Jerad Eickhoff and Jake Thompson, C Jorge Alfaro and OF Nick Williams.\n Diekman has suffered rom ulcerative colitis for most of his life, but in 2017, the pain became unbearable and he decided to undergo surgery. This was a much more complicated process than anticipated as he needed three different surgeries in his abdomen, resulting in the removal of his colon and the reconstruction of his digestive tract. He missed the first five months of the season as a result and eventually returned to the majors in September, pitching in 11 games. After the season, he was named the recipient of the Hutch Award for his work with sufferers of Crohn's disease and colitis.\n He split the 2018 season between the Rangers and Arizona Diamondbacks, pitching 71 games and going 1-2, 4.73. He was again traded in mid-season in 2019, starting the season with the Kansas City Royals before being dealt to the Oakland Athletics at the trading deadline. He appeared in a career-high 76 games that season, going 1-7, 4.65. He also pitched a third of an inning in Oakland's loss in the Wild Card Game. He was with Oakland in both 2020 and 2021 with 21 and 67 games respectively, putting up a sparkling 0.42 ERA in the pandemic-shortened season, and picking up 7 saves with a 3.86 ERA in 2021. He returned to the postseason in 2020 and pitched a total of 6 games, picking up a save in the Wild Card Series against the Chicago White Sox - after not getting one during the regular season.\n In March of 2022 he signed a free agent contract with the Boston Red Sox, who gave him a chance to be their closer. He blew his first save opportunity on Opening Day, April 8th when he was unable to close out a win in extra innings against the New York Yankees, when the designated runner came around to score, but registered a first save in spectacular fashion two days later when he struck out the heart of the Yankees' batting order in the 9th to preserve a 4-3 win, with Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Joey Gallo going down in order. However, that turned out to be his only save for Boston, as he was moved to different roles, and went 5-1, 4.23 in 44 games.

He was considered to have the best fastball in that year's draft. In 2017, he had been a 34th round selection by the Milwaukee Brewers but had decided to attend college. In the last regular season start of his sophomore year at Tennessee, he was hit in the face by a line drive and suffered a broken jaw, but returned two weeks later to pitch in the 2019 CWS Regionals. In 2020, as a junior, he pitched only 3 1/3 innings before the season was interrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic.\n Like many other top picks from the 2020 draft, as soon as he signed with the White Sox, he was added to their 60-player pool in order for him to work out with major leaguers and other top prospects at the team's alternative training site in Schaumburg, IL, with the minor leagues being shut down. Thus when he was called up to pitch for the big team on September 18th, he was not only the first player from the 2020 draft to appear in a major league game - doing so even before anyone selected in the 2019 draft had played in the majors - but also the first player since Mike Leake in 2009 to go straight to the majors. \n In his debut he pitched one scoreless inning in relief in a 7-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, striking two of three batters he faced and hitting 101 mph on the radar gun. He made 5 appearances in total, all in relief, pitching 6 innings in which he gave up just 3 hits and no runs, walking none and striking out 8. He was added to the White Sox's postseason roster, and in the decisive Game 3 of the Wild Card Series against the Oakland Athletics, he came into the game in relief of Dane Dunning in the 1st inning, striking out Matt Olson to end the frame with two runners on base. He then also struck out the first batter of the 2nd inning, Khris Davis, but something was off, as his fastball was around 95 and not customary 100 mph, and he was immediately removed from the game with forearm tightness. It turned out that manager Rick Renteria had decided to use him even though he was already feeling sore before the game, at the risk of exposing him to a serious injury, and ultimately this move cost Renteria and pitching coach Don Cooper their jobs a few days later. It turned out that there was no serious injury and the plans was to have him start the 2021 season with the big league team. He pitched 54 times in relief, going 3-5, 2.82 in 54 1/3 innings and picking up 65 strikeouts. He made three appearances in the Division Series against the Houston Astros and did not give up a run in spite of allowing 5 hits and a walk in 2 1/3 innings.\n He missed all of the 2022 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in the off-season."},

He is the nephew of Jesús Colome.\n Álex signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in March 2007; the scout was Eddy Toledo.  His pro debut was a mixed bag with the DSL Devil Rays, going 1-6 with a 2.97 ERA.  He fanned 50 in 39 1/3 innings but walked 31 and threw 16 wild pitches, tied for 6th most in the DSL.  In 2008, he had a 0-5, 6.80 record for the Princeton Rays, striking out 52 in 46 1/3 innings while showing better control (26 walks, 6 wild pitched).  Baseball America rated him the 24th best Rays prospect entering 2009.  In 2009, Colomé blossomed, going 7-4 with a 1.66 ERA for the Hudson Valley Renegades, striking out 94 in 76 innings while allowing a .174 opponent average.  He was 7th in the New York-Penn League in wins, first in strikeouts (11 ahead of runner-up Marty Popham) and second in ERA (behind Jose Alvarez).  Baseball America upgraded him to the 8th-best Tampa Bay prospect, also naming him the second prospect in the NYPL behind Ryan Westmoreland. \n The Dominican righty was 6-6 with a 3.95 ERA for the 2010 Bowling Green Hot Rods (118 strikeouts in 114 innings) and struck out 8 with one run allowed in four innings for the Charlotte Stone Crabs.  Baseball America listed him the 16th best prospect in the Midwest League (between Rubby de la Rosa and Chris Owings) and 9th in the Tampa Bay organization.  Colomé split 2011 between Charlotte (9-5, 3.66, .214 opponent average) and the Montgomery Biscuits (3-4, 4.15, .219 opponent average).  He struck out 123 in 157 2/3 innings while walking 72 and throwing 17 wild pitches.  Among Tampa Bay farmhands, he tied for second in wins (with Matt Moore and Victor Mateo, behind George Jensen), tied for third in wild pitches, tied for fifth in strikeouts and was third in walks.  Baseball America ranked him the 5th best Tampa Bay prospect and the 5th best Florida State League prospect (behind Shelby Miller, Matt Harvey, Hak-ju Lee and Trevor May).  He began 2012 back with the Biscuits and went 8-3 with a 3.48 ERA, striking out 75 in 75 innings. He made it to AAA for three games with the Durham Bulls (0-1, 3.24, 15 strikeouts in 16 2/3 innings).  He missed time that year due to shoulder problems.  He opened 2013 with a 4-5 record and 2.60 ERA for Durham with 61 strikeouts in 55 1/3 innings. He was among the IL leaders in both losses and strikeouts at that point.\t\n Colomé was called up to make his major league debut as the starting pitcher against the Miami Marlins on May 30, 2013.  He replaced Jake Odorizzi, who was sent down.  It was a successful debut, as he pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving up only an unearned run on five hits and two walks while striking out seven, receiving credit for the Rays' 5-2 win.  Surprisingly, pitching for a team known for developing its own players, he was the first product of the Rays' Dominican Academy to reach the major leagues.  He went 1-1, 2.25 in 3 starts that year, then in 2014 was 2-0, 2.66 in 5 games, 3 of them starts.  Following these first two successful [cups of coffee]] in the majors, he played his first full season for Tampa Bay in 2015.  Used as a swingman, he made 13 starts in 43 appearances, going 8-5, 3.94 and pitching 109 2/3 innings.\n In 2016, Álex became the Rays closer and had a breakthrough season.  He made the All-Star team, recorded 37 saves and went 2-4 with a sparkling ERA of 1.91.  In 56 2/3 innings, he struck out 71 opponents while issuing just 15 walks.  In the 2017 World Baseball Classic, he got a win for the Dominicans over championship-bound Team USA. He was less dominant in 2017 but led the American League in saves with 47 as he went 2-3, 3.24.  He made 65 appearances, pitched 66 2/3 innings, but saw his K/BB ratio fall to 58/23.  Despite the large number of saves he compiled, he was playing in relative anonymity, as the Rays were a middling team not attracting much media attention.  Tampa Bay decided to start a major rebuild during spring training 2018, a decision that was quite controversial as it seemed to confirm the developing narrative that a third of major league teams had no intention whatsoever of fielding a competitive team.  As an established closer just coming into his prime, a luxury on what was expected to be a losing team, he was widely expected to be among those traded, but he started the year in his familiar role.  On May 25th, the anticipated trade came, as he joined fellow veteran Denard Span in a trade to the Seattle Mariners for two young pitchers, Andrew Moore and Tommy Romero.  Colomé was 2-5, 4.15 in 23 games with 11 saves at the time.  With the Mariners, he was the set-up man for major league saves leader Edwin Diaz and went 5-0, 2.53 in 47 games with a save and 30 holds.  Seattle, sadly, faded in the second half after having made a bid for a postseason slot.\n After the 2018 season, the Mariners decided to shed some payroll. Álex was one of the players to be cast off: on November 30th he was traded to the Chicago White Sox for catcher Omar Narvaez. He pitched 62 times for the Sox, saving 30 games with a 4-5, 2.80 record in 2019. In 2020, his numbers were kept down by the season being chopped to 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic, but he was outstanding in his 21 appearances, going 2-0, 0.81 with 12 saves and limiting opponents to 13 hits and 8 walks in 22 1/3 innings for a WHIP of 0.940. He appeared in the postseason for the first time, pitching twice in the Wild Card Series, giving up just a walk in two innings and picking up the save in the Sox's lone win against the Oakland Athletics, in Game 1 of the series. Following the season, he became a free agent and on February 3, 2021 he reportedly signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Twins for $5 million in a depressed free agent market."},

He did just that, inking a $2.7 million contract with the Chicago White Sox in January of 2022. He was slated to start that season in the minor leagues. He was named to the American League team for the 2022 Futures Game as he moved from High A to Double A to Triple A for a brief stint at the end of the season.

However, on Opening Day, against the Houston Astros on March 30th, Romy Gonzalez started in right field and Oscar came in as a pinch-hitter for him in the 7th inning, singling off Hector Neris. He then played the rest of the game in right and made an out in his only other at-bat as Chicago snapped Houston's streak of ten straight opening day wins with a 3-2 victory."},

In first four big league seasons, he has recorded 563 strikeouts but then ran into injury issues.  \n Mike was originally selected by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 4th round of the 2011 amateur draft, out of Seminole Community College. On August 7, 2014, he was traded by the Angels to the Cleveland Indians in a very bad deal that netted the Halos a cooked Vinnie Pestano for their bullpen. When he made his major league debut for the Indians on May 18, 2016, Pestano had already washed out of the bigs the prior summer. In his first game, he started against the Cincinnati Reds and gave up 4 runs in 5 1/3 innings for a no-decision as Cleveland eventually prevailed, 8-7, in 12 innings.  He went 3-3, 5.26 in 17 games, including 10 starts. Mike was on the team's postseason roster due to injuries to starters Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar and was used four times in long relief during the Tribe's run to Game 7 of the World Series - once in the ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays and three times against the Chicago Cubs in the Fall Classic.  He had no decisions and a 4.76 ERA in 5 2/3 innings.\n Clevinger started the 2017 in the minors but was called up to Cleveland on May 7th to replaced the injured Corey Kluber. Starting against the Kansas City Royals, he gave up no runs in 5 2/3 innings in starting a 1-0 combined one-hit shutout. The lone safety was a double by Salvador Perez in the 4th. With the Indians in first place, but needing to strengthen their roster a bit at the trading deadline, Clevinger was the one player most teams wanted from the Indians, but they were adamant about not trading him. On August 12th, he rewarded the brass for the confidence shown by by striking out 9 batters in 7 innings in defeating the Tampa Bay Rays, 3-0, for his first win since the All-Star break. He had another great performance on September 8th, when he pitched 6 shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles in a 5-0 win that was Cleveland's 16th in a row. On September 13th, he was credited with Cleveland's historic 21st straight win that set a new American League record. In that game, he allowed three runs - only one earned - to the Detroit Tigers in 5 2/3 innings as the Indians won, 5-3, and he improved to 10-5 on the year. While he pitched very well as a starter, the Indians used him out of the bullpen in his last couple of appearances during the regular season, in order to prepare him for the role the was going to play in the postseason. In 27 games, Mike finished 12-6 with a 3.11 ERA and 137 strikeouts in 121 2/3 innings. In the postseason, he pitched 1 1/3 innings in two relief outings against the New York Yankees in the Division Series.\n On September 22, 2018, Clevinger reached the 200-strikeout mark for the first time of his career. He was the fourth pitcher on the Indians' staff to record 200 strikeouts that season, after Corey Kluber, Carlos Carrasco and Trevor Bauer, making the Indians the first team in major league history to have four such pitchers. He went 13-8, 3.02 in 32 starts, logging an even 200 innings and finishing with 207 strikeouts. He started Game 3 of the Division Series against the Houston Astros on October 8th and allowed just a run in 5 innings, striking out 9. It took him 99 pitches, and he gave way to Trevor Bauer in the top of the 6th, but Bauer could not hold the 2-1 lead as Houston went on to win, 11-3, sweeping the series.  \n Mike started strong in 2019, not giving up a run on just 2 hits over his first 12 innings while striking out 22, but he left his second start, against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 7th, after just 5 innings, complaining of back pain. It turned out to be more serious than anticipated, as he went on the injured list due to a major muscle strain, with the initial prognosis being that he would miss from six to eight weeks. He returned on June 17th and, after losing his first two starts, began to roll along like an unstoppable boulder. He was 4-0, 1.74 in July and 5-0, 1.96 in August, being named the American League Pitcher of the Month the latter month. Not coincidentally, the Indians, who had struggled in his absence, were back in the thick of the postseason race by then. Despite the shortened season, Mike finished 13-4 with a 2.71 ERA and a dominant 169 strikeouts with only 96 hits allowed in 126 innings, but the Indians missed the postseason.\n He was 1-1, 3.24 after 3 starts in 2020 when on August 10th, it was revealed that he had violated the health and safety protocols imposed by MLB because of the Coronavirus pandemic, by making an unauthorized trip out of his hotel when the team was in Chicago, IL. He was the second Indians pitcher in two days caught in the act, after Zach Plesac, and he was immediately sent home and placed in quarantine, while he followed the procedure for players who were feared to have been exposed to the virus. The Indians then decided to punish the two further by sending them to the alternate training site for a spell, as their teammates were properly incensed at their stupid and selfish behavior. After a time in purgatory, Clevinger was called back on August 26th, the team having unexpectedly not missed a beat in the absence of 40% of its starting rotation. However, all was not smooth, as it became clear that the Indians were shopping him around with the August 31st trading deadline on the horizon, feeling that he had become a distraction but could still land a good haul that could help the team for the postseason. There were apparently a number of teams interested and a deal was consummated on the deadline itself, with the extremely active San Diego Padres winning the sweepstakes with a nine-player blockbuster. The Padres obtained Clevinger, OF Greg Allen and a player to be named later in return for C Austin Hedges, 1B/OF Josh Naylor, P Cal Quantrill, SS Gabriel Arias, IF Owen Miller and P Joey Cantillo. He made his first start with the Padres on September 3rd, a 2-0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, allowing 2 runs in 6 innings. It was clear however that the Padres were seeing him as their ace and were hoping that he would start their first postseason game in 14 years a month down the road. That came into doubt on September 23rd as he had to leave a start against the Angels after one inning due to biceps tightness, and was scheduled to undergo an MRI. He did not pitch again during the regular season, missed the first round of the postseason, and made his return on October 6th, when he started Game 1 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers; however, he pitched just one inning and left after just two pitches in the 2nd, complaining from pain in his elbow. That was it for him and on November 16th, on the day he signed a two-year deal worth $11.5 million, avoiding arbitration, the Padres announced he would undergo Tommy John surgery and miss all of 2021.\n When he returned in 2022, he went 7-7, 4.33 for a Padres team that had missed the postseason in his absence, but returned to the dance that year. He made 22 starts in 23 appearances and recorded 91 strikeouts in 114 1/3 innings. He was only considered the team's fourth starter in the postseason, but still made a couple of starts as the Padres went deeper than anyone thought possible, losing to the Philadelphia Phillies at the NLCS stage. His first postseason start was against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the Division Series on October 11th, but he was hit hard, allowing 5 runs in 2 2/3 innings to be charged with a 5-3 loss. In Game 4 of the NLCS against the Phillies on October 22nd, he did even worse, failing to retire a single batter as he was removed after facing just four batters, three of whom went on to score, but he was not involved in the decision as the Padres lost the game, 10-6. He became a free agent after the season and on December 4th signed a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox for $12 million.\n On January 24, 2023, it was reported that Clevinger was under investigation by Major League Baseball for domestic abuse following allegations levied by his former partner. There was no escaping comparisons with the case of Trevor Bauer, a former teammate whose career had been virtually ended by similar allegations, but Clevinger claimed his case was different and that outsiders should not rush to judgment. He denied all of the allegations and expressed confidence that he would be exonerated. In another major difference with Bauer's case, he was not put on paid administrative leave during the investigation, and was able to come to spring training with his new team. According to the pitcher, MLB had been investigating the case since the previous August but the White Sox said they were not aware of this at the time of signing him as the whole matter was still handled confidentially at the time. On March 5th, MLB announced that it had completed its investigation and had not found any evidence that Clevinger had violated its joint policy on domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse."},

Dylan was going a bit deeper into his games, with 51 2/3 innings pitched, but still fewer than 4 per start.  On July 13th, he was one of four prospects traded to the Chicago White Sox in return for major league starter José Quintana; joining him were outfielder Eloy Jimenez, and infielders Matt Rose and Bryant Flete.\n A veteran of the 2018 Futures Game, Dylan made his major league debut on July 3, 2019.  He walked the first three batters he faced, giving up 3 runs but striking out 6 in 5 innings in a start against the Detroit Tigers in the first game of a doubleheader.  On the season, he finished 4-7, 5.79 with 81 strikeouts in 14 starts (73 innings). In 2020, he made 12 starts for Chicago in the pandemic-shortened season, going 5-4, 4.01; he led the American League with 34 walks in 58 1/3 innings. He then pitched one scoreless inning in relief in the postseason.\n He had a career game on May 4, 2021. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he allowed just one hit in 6 innings while striking out 11 to receive credit for a 9-0 win. He also batted for the first time of his professional career, and went 3 for 3 with a double. He was just the fourth pitcher since 1961 to obtain a hit in his first three career plate appearances, following Larry Miller, T.J. Tucker and Steven Matz. He went 13-7, 3.91 in 32 games that season, being tied for the American League lead in starts, and logging 165 2/3 innings. He struck out 226 batters, third most in the league. He also had the highest K/9 IP ratio in the league, and led in wild pitches with 13. He started Game 3 of the Division Series against the Houston Astros on October 10th, but left after just 1 2/3 innings, having allowed 3 runs on 2 hits and 3 walks; Chicago lost the game, 12-6.\n He put up a very unusual pitching line in a start against the New York Yankees on May 12, 2012. On the one hand, in four innings of work, he recorded 11 strikeouts, with only one out being recorded by his defense. But he was not by any means dominant as the Yankees managed 6 hits and 2 walks off him, and five of the hits went for extra bases, including a pair of homers by Giancarlo Stanton. This resulted in 6 runs, but he ended up with a no-decision as his teammates managed to tie the score in the bottom of the 7th, before losing the game, 15-7, when the Yankees erupted for 7 runs in the 8th. He was the American League Pitcher of the Month in June when he put up a minuscule 0.33 ERA, allowing but a single earned run. He repeated as Pitcher of the Month in July, as he went 5-1 with an 0.76 ERA and 40 strikeouts in 35 2/3 innings. Yet he somehow failed to be named to the All-Star team. On August 5th, he made it 13 straight starts of allowing one earned run or none when he gave up just 1 run in 6 innings against the Texas Rangers. He became the first player to accomplish that since ERA became an official statistic in 1913. The win improved his record to 12-4 on the season. He extended the streak one more game, to 14, before giving up 3 runs in 5 innings in a no-decision against the Houston Astros on August 16th. On September 3rd, he came within one out of pitching a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins, throwing 8 2/3 hitless innings before Luis Arraez hit a single to a right-center. Dylan then struck out the next batter, Kyle Garlick, to complete the one-hitter, a 13-0 win that improved his record to 13-6. It was his second career complete game and shutout, having pitched one the previous year."},

He was taken by the Boston Red Sox with the seventh overall pick in the 2015 amateur draft.  A few days later, he was named the winner of the Dick Howser Trophy, given to the best collegiate player in the country, on the strength of a junior season in which he hit .380/.489/.715 with 19 homers and 47 walks.  He also won the Golden Spikes Award.  He soon made his pro debut with the Lowell Spinners.  In his first pro season, split between Lowell of the New York-Penn League and the Greenville Drive of the South Atlantic League, Andrew hit for a combined .313/.416/.556 with 11 homers and 31 RBI in 54 games, confirming his place as one of the top hitting prospects in the minor leagues.  In 2016, he began the season with Class A Salem Red Sox, but after a little more than a month, during which he hit a scorching .341, he was promoted to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Double A Eastern League.  He was named to the United States team in the 2016 Futures Game and was the lead-off hitter in the game.  On August 1st, he was hitting .295 and slugging .515 in 63 games for Portland when Boston announced that they were calling him up to the big leagues. \n Andrew was expected to initially share left field duties with Brock Holt and Bryce Brentz.  He made his debut on August 3rd, coming on as a pinch-hitter for Brentz in the 7th inning of a 5-4 loss to the Seattle Mariners, later striking out against Edwin Diaz in the 9th to end the game after replacing Brentz in left field. He collected his first two big league hits the next day, starting the game in left field and batted 9th facing Hisashi Iwakuma, going 2-for-3 in a 3-1 loss.  On August 7th, he had three hits, two RBI, a run and a stolen base in an 8-5 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, completing an excellent first week.  He continued his great hitting with his first game at Fenway Park on August 9th, going 3-for-3 in a 5-3 win over the New York Yankees.  He barely missed hitting his first career home run, as it took a video review to determine his line drive off the center field wall at the point where it meets the Green Monster had not, in fact, left the park before bouncing back onto the field.  On August 22nd, he made the news for his defensive ability, as he made a tremendous catch in the outfield, robbing the Tampa Bay Rays' Steven Souza of a home run by climbing way up the wall in the left field corner at Tropicana Field, grabbing the ball that was well over the wall, then almost flipping over before managing to regain his balance, holding on to the ball all the time.  Only three days later, on August 25th, he was placed on the disabled list with a left knee sprain.  He suffered the injury trying to avoid a tag at second base the previous day.  He finished the season at .295 with 2 homers and 14 RBI in 34 games, then started all three games of the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians, going 3 for 9 with a double and a homer as the Red Sox were swept.\n Benintendi entered 2017 as many observers' choice to be the Rookie of the Year in the American League, some even calling him the next great Red Sox left fielder in the line of Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice.  That was a lot to live up to but, at least on Opening Day, he did.  Facing the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 3rd, he hit a three-run homer off Gerrit Cole in the 5th to lead Boston to a 5-3 win.  He hit .333 in April, then slowed down in May when he batted only .204, but picked up the pace again in June.  He had his first two-homer game on June 4th in a 7-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles then, on June 13th, had the first walk-off hit of his career, when he drove in Xander Bogaerts with a 12th-inning single off Luis Garcia, giving the Red Sox a 4-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.  On July 4th, he had a five-hit game, homered twice, drove in 6 runs and also made a great catch in left field in an 11-4 win over the Texas Rangers.  He was the first Red Sox rookie ever to have two five-hit games in a season, the first one having come on April 23rd.  A day earlier, his two-run bloop single in the 11th inning provided the margin of victory in a 7-5 win over Texas.  On August 12th, he hit a pair of three-run homers in an important 10-5 win over the New York Yankees with Boston fighting to maintain its slim lead over the Bronx Bombers.  He started the month on a tear, going 15-for-31 with 4 homers and 5 steals and ended up being named the American League Rookie of the Month on the strength of a .333 average, 18 runs scored, 19 RBI and 6 homers. He finished second in Rookie of the Year voting, behind the juggernaut Yankees rookie Aaron Judge, and batted .271 with 20 home runs and 90 RBI in 154 games. \n Andrew continued to play well in 2018, and was a candidate for the American League Final Man Vote at the All-Star Game, with a slash line of .293/.379/.515 at vote time. He would ultimately lose out to Jean Segura of the Seattle Mariners and finish the season a .290 hitter with 16 homers and 87 RBI in 148 games; he also scored 103 runs, putting him 6th in the league. In the postseason, Andrew made a tremendous catch to end Game 4 of the 2018 ALCS and seal Boston's 8-6 win over the Houston Astros on October 17th. With two outs and the bases loaded, he grabbed Alex Bregman's sinking line drive inches off the ground in a spectacular play. After the season, on December 22nd, the Associated Press voted the catch as its \"Play of the Year\" in a poll covering all sports played in 2018. He batted .333 in 18 at bats in the World Series, a five-game triumph over the Los Angeles Dodgers. \n His numbers took a step back in 2019, as he batted a career low .266 with 13 homers and 68 RBI in 138 games. On July 27th, he hit the shortest home run of the season. His pop-up off CC Sabathia of the Yankees barely traveled 310 feet but landed just inside the Pesky Pole at Fenway Park and was ruled a homer after a video review (it was originally called a double). According to statcast, the expected batting average on such a hit was a whopping .010, but he hit it in just the right spot in the right ballpark. The Red Sox missed the postseason in 2019, but that was nothing compared to the 2020 season, when Boston had a terrible season and Andrew suited up for only 14 of their 60 games - that was the season that was decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic - and hit .103 with just 1 RBI, the result of going 4 for 39. His season was sunk by a rib injury. Belying the motto that you should never trade a player when his value is at his lowest, the Red Sox did just that before the 2021 season, as exactly one year after their controversial trade of Mookie Betts, they sent Benintendi packing on February 10th. In this case, it was part of a three-team deal, with the Kansas City Royals obtaining him in return for OF Franchy Cordero, P Josh Winckowski and two players to be named later; the Royals had just obtained Winckowski from the New York Mets in return for another prospect, OF Khalil Lee.\n Benintendi had a bounce-back season with Kansas City in 2021, hitting.276 in 134 games, with 27 doubles, 17 homers, 63 runs and 73 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 106. He also won a Gold Glove as the best defensive left fielder in the American League. However, it was achieved for a team that was completely out of the running and not receiving much coverage - a contrast with his years in Boston. In 2022, he built on that and raised it up a notch during the first half, as he was named the Royals' representative to the 2022 All-Star Game amid rumors that he would be traded before the end of July, since he was due to become a free agent at the end of the season.  He was hitting .321 in 92 games. Although his power was down to just 3 homers, his OPS+ was 124. He was the subject of a lot of criticism in K.C. just before the All-Star break when he missed a four-game series played in Toronto, ON because of being unvaccinated. The trade happened on July 27th, and even though the New York Yankees were likely to need to play a few important games against the Toronto Blue Jays over the last two months or in the postseason, they were the ones who acquired him, sending three pitching prospects to do so: Beck Way, Chandler Champlain and T.J. Sikkema. The Yankees had been a juggernaut all season, but one of their few concerns was lack of production from OFs Joey Gallo and Aaron Hicks, something the trade was meant to address. Benintendi played 33 games for New York, hitting .254 with an OPS+ of 110, then had to go on the injured list on September 4th with a broken hamate bone in his right wrist, an injury sustained while swinging the bat two days earlier. He was likely to require surgery, but was optimistic he would be able to return by then end of the month, based on his experience with a similar injury in college. However, he was unable to return, missing the remainder of the season and the postseason as well.\n Benintendi became a free agent following the 2022 season. It was often reported that the Yankees were very interested in bringing him back as soon as they dealt with the pesky issue of re-signing Aaron Judge, but when the dust settled, Benintendi signed instead with the Chicago White Sox on December 16th. The five-year deal was reported to be worth $75 million. Surprisingly, in the age of contracts reaching multiple of a hundred million dollars, this made it the largest contract ever granted by the White Sox, surpassing the $73 million given out to C Yasmani Grandal."},

He is the brother of Erold Andrus.\n Andrus was signed by scout Rolando Petit for the Atlanta Braves at age 16. He debuted professionally in 2005, hitting .295/.377/.398 for the GCL Braves and going 5 for 18 with 4 walks and a double for the Danville Braves. He led Gulf Coast League shortstops with 63 putouts. Baseball America rated him the #4 prospect in the GCL behind Andrew McCutchen, Jay Bruce and Chris Volstad and the #2 Braves prospect. In 2006, Elvis hit .265/.324/.362 with 23 steals in 38 tries for the Rome Braves as a teenager in a full-season league. He led South Atlantic League shortstops with 208 putouts and was named to the SAL All-Star team as a utility infielder. Baseball America again ranked him his league's 4th-best prospect.\n Andrus only batted .244/.330/.335 for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans in 2007, though he stole 25 bases in 32 tries. He still was chosen for the 2007 Futures Game. Pinch-hitting for Chin-Lung Hu in the 5th, he grounded out against Luke Hochevar and stayed in to play shortstop. In the 7th inning, Andrus struck out versus Clay Buchholz. Later that year, he was dealt with Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Beau Jones, Neftali Feliz and Matt Harrison to the Texas Rangers in exchange for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay. Going to the Bakersfield Blaze, Andrus hit .300/.373/.369 and stole 15 bases in 23 attempts in 27 games. Assigned to the Grand Canyon Rafters in the Arizona Fall League, Andrus batted .353/.411/.471. He played for the World team again in the 2008 Futures Game. This time, he started at shortstop and hit second. In the first inning, he hit a potential double-play grounder but was able to reach thanks to an error by US shortstop Jason Donald. Elvis stole third and came home on a Pablo Sandoval grounder for the winning run in a 3-0 victory. He walked against Brett Anderson in the third but was picked off. Ramiro Pena replaced him at short. During the 2008 campaign, Andrus hit .295/.350/.367 for the Frisco RoughRiders with 54 steals in 70 tries and 82 runs. He led Texas farmhands in steals and was five swipes behind Texas League leader Corey Wimberly. Named the loop's All-Star shortstop, Andrus led the TL's shortstops in putouts (181), assists (361), errors (32) and double plays (79). Baseball America rated him the best defensive shortstop and the best infield arm in the Texas League. The publication also rated him the #5 prospect in the TL behind only Dexter Fowler, Chris Davis, Kyle Blanks and Vin Mazzaro.\n In 2009, Elvis won the job as the Rangers' starting shortstop in spring training. There was some controversy attached to the decision by manager Ron Washington, as it meant moving Michael Young, who had won the 2008 Gold Glove Award, to third base. He went 1 for 4 with a double and a run scored on Opening Day against the Cleveland Indians. He had a decent first season in the majors, playing excellent defense at shortstop and hitting .267/.329/.373 in 145 games, with 33 stolen bases in 39 tries. He was the second-youngest player in the 2009 AL behind only Rick Porcello. He finished second in voting for the 2009 American League Rookie of the Year Award, losing out to Andrew Bailey in a fairly close race. He hit only .247/.287/.321 in winter ball for the Navegantes del Magallanes. \n In 2010 Andrus maintained his batting average and improved his on-base percentage from .329 to .342 over his rookie year, but his power went down significantly. In 588 at-bats, he managed only 18 extra-base hits (15 doubles and 3 triples to slug .301), losing 5 triples and 6 homers over the previous year in more plate appearances. He continued to play excellent defense and scored 88 runs as the Rangers not only won their first ever postseason series, but made it all the way to the World Series. Andrus hit .333 in each of the first two rounds of the postseason, although his bat was stymied by the San Francisco Giants in the Series. He also appeared in the 2010 All-Star Game, pinch-running for Derek Jeter in the 6th and replacing him at short in a 3-1 loss. He was caught stealing by Brian McCann, then grounded out later against Brian Wilson. For the season, he tied for 9th in the league with 32 steals (even with Coco Crisp), tied Chone Figgins for the most sacrifice hits (17), and tied Figgins for second in times caught stealing (15, 2 behind Juan Pierre). \n Elvis ended his 705 at-bat home run drought in the fourth game of the 2011 season, going deep against Erik Bedard of the Seattle Mariners on April 4th. He hit .279/.347/.361 in 150 games, collecting 164 hits, including 27 doubles and 5 homers. He scored 96 runs and stole 37 bases in 49 tries. He was 5th in the AL in steals (between Jacoby Ellsbury and B.J. Upton), third in sacrifice hits (16), tied for fourth in times caught stealing (even with Upton), second in putouts at shortstop (245, behind Alcides Escobar), 3rd in assists at short (407), first in errors at short (25) and tied for first in double plays by a shortstop (102, even with Erick Aybar). The Rangers returned to the World Series that year, with Andrus starting each of their 17 postseason games at shortstop. He went 6 for 25 with 4 runs scored as they defeated the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS, and then 8 for 29 (.276) with 5 runs in a crushing seven-game loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Fall Classic. \n In 2012, Andrus played 158 games as the Rangers' starting shortstop, being selected to the All-Star Game for the second time. In the All-Star Game, he replaced Miguel Cabrera at third in the 9th inning and had one assist. In his trip to the plate, he hit into a force against Wade Miley. He hit .286/.349/.378 with 85 runs scored, banging out 180 hits, 31 doubles and 9 triples, all of these personal bests. In the final weeks of the season, the Rangers brought up the team's top prospect, Jurickson Profar, another shortstop, who impressed with his bat at a very young age, although Andrus continued to be the starter. Meanwhile, the Rangers, who had led the AL West race for most of the season, lost the division to the Oakland A's on the season's final day and were forced to play the first American League Wild Card Game against the Baltimore Orioles. Andrus did his part, going 2 for 4, but Texas lost the game, 5-1. For the season, he was among the league leaders in triples (2nd, one behind Austin Jackson), putouts at shortstop (4th, 233), assists (4th, 414) and errors (3rd, 16, behind Escobar and Asdrubal Cabrera). Playing winter ball for the first time in three years, he batted .234/.342/.344 for Magallanes and had nearly a .500 OBP in the postseason as the team won it all. He did not accompany them to the 2013 Caribbean Series. \n There were plenty of trade rumors involving both Andrus and Profar in the offseason, but when spring training opened in 2013, both were still with the Rangers. On February 28th, Andrus added his name to the list of baseball's most unusual injuries, bowing out of a Cactus League game with \"sensitivity and muscle soreness\" in his left shoulder. He had just gotten a tattoo, running from the top of the shoulder to the biceps, commemorating his late father. A few days later, he joined the Venezuelan national team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The Rangers ended all speculation about his future on April 4th when they signed him to an eight-year contract extension worth $120 million through 2022, with an option for an additional year. In the meantime, Profar was sent to AAA to complete his minor league apprenticeship, leaving Andrus in his familiar position as the starting shortstop on Opening Day. On May 18th, Andrus made a bid for a cycle in leading the Rangers to a 7-2 win over the Detroit Tigers. He had four hits in his first four at-bats, scoring three runs, driving in two and stealing a base, then came up again in the 8th needing a home run. He swung hard on the first three pitches but was not able to drive a pitch out, notching a third single to finish with a 5-for-5 day at the plate. He hit .271 in 156 games that season with 91 runs scored, 4 homers and 67 RBI.\n Andrus remained the Rangers' starting shortstop from 2014 to the start of the 2018 season, hardly ever missing any time: the fewest games he played during those four season was 147 in 2016. Texas won back-to-back division titles in 2015 and 2016, but both years exited the postseason in the Division Series after losing to the Toronto Blue Jays. He was just 4 for 22 in the 2015 ALDS, but his 4 for 11 performance with a triple and a homer was for naught in the 2016 ALDS as the Rangers were swept in three games. In the regular season, he had his best year in 2016, when he hit .302 with 8 homers and 69 RBI, for an OPS+ of 110, the first time in his career he had been above 100.  He repeated that feat in 2017, hitting .297 with surprising power - 44 doubles and 20 homers - scoring a career-high 100 runs and driving in 88, another personal best. This allowed him to overcome the fact he drew just 38 walks, as he finished with an OPS+ of 108. He did lead the AL in caught stealing with 10, something he had also done in 2014 with 15, while stealing between 24 and 27 bases each of the four seasons in that span. \n He came back as the team's starter at shortstop in 2018, but on April 11th, he was hit by a pitch from Los Angeles Angels reliever Keynan Middleton and broke his right elbow, putting him on the disabled list. He was off to a good start, hitting .327 with 2 homers and 5 RBI in 14 games. When he returned in June, he scuffled, finishing the season with a .256/.308/.367 line behind 6 homers and 33 RBI in 97 games, his lowest total to that point. He showed modest improvement in a full tilt in 2019, racking up a .275/.313/.393 line, chipping in 12 homers and 72 RBI in 147 games. However, the improvement was largely an illusion, as both seasons were worth an equal OPS+ of 78. In 2020, he lost his starting job during the pandemic-shortened season, appearing in just 29 games and hitting .194 with 3 homers and 7 RBIs. His OPS+ fell even further, to 58, the worst of his career by a long shot.\n He was clearly no longer in the Rangers' future plans at that point, and on February 6, 2021, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics in return for another former star whose luster had paled, slugger Khris Davis, as well as two prospects, C Jonah Heim and P Dane Acker, while C Aramis Garcia accompanied Elvis to the Bay Area. Andrus was joining a team that had just lost its starting shortstop, Marcus Semien, who had left via free agency, so there was an opportunity for him to claim some regular playing time again - if he could still produce. He played 146 games for the A's, who missed the postseason by only a couple of wins, hitting .243 with 3 homers and 37 RBIs for an OPS+ of 73. He returned to the A's in 2022, but by then the team had started a major rebuild, getting rid of some star players like 1B Matt Olson, 3B Matt Chapman and P Sean Manaea during spring training and receiving only prospects in return. Elvis was left as one of the few veterans on the team, but he played better for a team that had trouble winning games, hitting .237 in 106 games, with 8 homers and 30 RBIs for an OPS+ of 96. On August 17th, he was released by Oakland after the team had failed to be able to find a taker for his services at the trading deadline, but two days later he was signed by the Chicago White Sox, who had lost their own starting shortstop, Tim Anderson, for the remainder of the season. He continued to do well the rest of the way, hitting .271 in 43 games, with another 9 homers and an OPS+ of 116. Combined, his line of .249 with 17 homers and 58 RBIs was one of the best of his career (his OPS+ of 103 was his highest since 2017, and only the third time he had ever finished above 100, and his home run total his second-highest in 14 seasons), making him a surprisingly valuable player. However, the question was whether this was his last hurrah.\n It took Elvis a while to find a team for 2023 as he had to face the reality that at 34, even coming off a productive season, no one was looking at him as a starting shortstop anymore. Finally, on February 19, he came to an agreement to return to the White Sox on a one-year deal, but had to agree to move to second base as there was no replacing a healthy Tim Anderson. He would have to beat incumbent Romy Gonzalez to claim the starting job, however. On April 5th, he reached an important milestone with his 2,000th career hit, a single to right against the San Francisco Giants. It came in a rare appearance at shortstop, as Anderson had been ejected from the game for protesting a pitch clock violation. The hit broke a 0 for 14 streak after he had picked up hits in the first two games of the year after winning the starting second base job in spring training. He was only the fourth active player with that many hits, trailing only Miguel Cabrera, Joey Votto and Nelson Cruz.\n Sources:"},

Going into 2014, he was ranked the #3 prospect in the White Sox system by Baseball America (behind Jose Abreu and Erik Johnson). That year, he hit .303/.328/.481 with 9 home runs, 21 doubles and 10 steals for the AZL White Sox, Winston-Salem Dash and Birmingham Barons. In that year's Arizona Fall League, he hit .301/.343/.430 in 23 games. Entering 2015, he was named the #2 prospect in the White Sox chain (behind Carlos Rodon), the #92 prospect in the entire minor leagues by Baseball America and the #39 overall prospect by Baseball Prospectus. He batted .312/.350/.429 with 21 doubles, 12 triples and 49 stolen bases in 125 games for the Barons. Heading into 2016, BA ranked him #45 in the entire minor leagues and #1 in the White Sox chain. He was named a Mid-Season All-Star in 2014 and 2015 (and was the Top Star in 2015), a Post-Season All-Star in 2015 and the Best Hustler and Best Utility Player in the Southern League in 2015.\n Anderson was called up to Chicago to make his major league debut in June 2016. He hit his first major league homer June 21st, leading off a game at Fenway Park by going deep against Clay Buchholz and sending the White Sox on their way to a 3-1 win. He was quickly installed as the starting shortstop, with the team releasing veteran Jimmy Rollins shortly after his arrival. In 99 games, he hit .283 with 9 homers and 30 RBI while scoring 57 runs. One area of concern was that he walked only 13 times, while striking out 117, an imbalance that could eventually turn problematic. Still, the White Sox were pleased by what they had seen, and heading into 2017 they signed him to a six-year contract worth $25 million, buying out his arbitration years and setting up potential options for two more seasons at a significantly higher rate of pay. It was the most lucrative deal ever offered to a player with less than a full year of major league experience, topping the $17.5 million given to Evan Longoria by the Tampa Bay Rays shortly after his big league debut. That year, he hit .257 in 143 games, with 17 homers and 56 RBI, but his OBP was just .276, and he only drew 13 walks while striking out 162 times. He improved that awful ratio only slightly in 2018, to 30/149, but also hit just .240. When he did make contact though, it was solid, as he hit 28 doubles and 20 homers.\n He took a big step forward at the start of the 2019 season, as he had a great first month. He hit .381 with 6 homers and 17 RBI in 22 games to be named the American League Player of the Month. While his walk percentage (2.9%) remained problematic, he won the American League batting crown, batting .335/.357/.508 over 123 games. He had another good season in 2020 as the White Sox returned to the postseason in a season shortened to 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic. He played in 49 games and led the AL with 45 runs scored as teammate Jose Abreu was the league's best run producer. He batted .322/.357/.529, won a Silver Slugger Award for the first time and finished 7th in the voting for the 2020 American League Most Valuable Player Award (Abreu was the winner). In his first taste of the postseason, he went a scorching 9-for-14 in the White Sox's loss to the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Series.\n In 2021, he was named an All-Star for the first time as the White Sox ran away from all their opponents in the AL Central in spite of playing without OFs Eloy Jimenez and Luis Robert for most of the first half; Anderson and Abreu carried the team in their absence. He was the hero of the \"Field of Dreams Game\" played in a temporary ballpark erected in a cornfield in Dyersville, IA on August 12th to commemorate the 1989 movie Field of Dreams: with the White Sox trailing 8-7 in the bottom of the 9th after coughing up a three-run lead, he hit a two-run walk-off homer off Zack Britton into the cornrows to end the thrilling game and give his team a 9-8 win over the New York Yankees. As the season was winding down in late September, he was given a three-game suspension for making contact with umpire Tim Timmons on September 27th. The incident occurred in the 9th inning after benches had cleared in the game with the Detroit Tigers, the result of an altercation being Jose Abreu and Niko Goodrum. Anderson appealed the suspension, likely pushing it back into the following season. He later recognized that he did push Timmons in the heat of the scuffle because he was right on him, but that he did it without realizing it was the umpire. He finished the season at .309 in 123 games with 17 homers, 94 runs and 61 RBIs for an OPS+ of 118. The White Sox won a division title and in the Division Series against the Houston Astros, he went 7 for 19 with 4 runs scores, but the Sox lost in four games; it was his second straight year of putting up superlative postseason numbers as his team went down to defeat.\n He started 2022 as one of the few players in the line-up to be hitting well on a Chicago team that was in a collective hitting slump. After 35 games, he was at .359 with 5 homers and 18 RBIs. That is when he was at the center of a controversy blown up by the fact it took place at New Yankee Stadium. in a game against the Yankees on May 21st, 3B Josh Donaldson taunted him as he slid into the bag with the name \"Jackie\", apparently based on the fact that an article in Sports Illustrated in 2019 had compared Anderson to the great Jackie Robinson. Anderson found the action to be disrespectful and tainted with racism and objected strongly, which led to benches clearing (but no punches being exchanged) and a media tempest. The Commissioner's office said it would investigate the incident, and later issued a one-game suspension and a fine of an undisclosed amount to Donaldson. He was named to the All-Star team for the second time that season. On July 30th, he was isued a three-game suspension for coming into contact with umpire Nick Mahrley the day before, after Mahrley had ejected him for arguing a strike three call. Manager Tony LaRussa was also ejected as a result of the dispute. The suspension was reduced to two games on appeal and he began serving it on August 7th."},

Unfortunately, his efforts were largely wasted for a miserable O's squad that finished 54-108, 49 games behind the first-place New York Yankees.\n In 2022, playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he was used as a pitcher no less than 10 times in 73 games.

His 10 games were the most by anyone in this role, and he did not do badly, with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings. Interestingly, in 8 of his 10 outings, he came in with the Dodgers holding a big lead in the 9th inning and finished the game, and in the majority of these the opposing team had also resorted to putting a position player on the mound before he had come in, in effect putting up a white flag. Only two of his appearances were in the more traditional role of mop-up man on the wrong end of a lopsided score."},

He went 1-4, 3.68, logging 44 innings and striking out 53 opponents. On July 16th, he combined with three other pitchers to pitch a no-hitter in the Gulf Coast League. In 2017, he spent a full season with the Rome Braves of the South Atlantic League where he was 8-3, 2.60 in 26 starts totaling 131 2/3 innings. He allowed just 99 hits and struck out 152 batters to confirm his high draft rank had been justified. He was named the league's Pitcher of the Year as well as a postseason All-Star. In 2018, he continued to impress with the Florida Fire Frogs of the Florida State League where he was 3-4, 2.28 in  16 starts. However, he was limited to just 67 innings. He was headed for a tremendous season and had a 2.03 ERA in mid-July, but then missed the rest of the month and most of August, before losing his last 2 starts.\n Wentz began the 2019 season with the Mississippi Braves, but struggled at first in this initial taste of AA action. through his first 14 starts at the level, Wentz limped to a 5.51 ERA. However, following six scoreless innings against the Jackson Generals on June 26th, he was on the upswing. Wentz recorded a 3.25 ERA in his final six games with Mississippi. (a number that falls to 1.67 if you cut out his final outing on July 27th against the Mobile BayBears) On July 31th Wentz was on the move, but not to a new level. Instead, he was packaged with Travis Demeritte in a deal for Detroit Tigers closer Shane Greene. The move to the Southern League and the Erie SeaWolves, however, did not slow his role, as Wentz went on to post a 2.10 ERA and a 13.0 K/9 in five outings with Detroit's AA outfit. Prior to the 2020 season, Wentz was named Detroit's 8th best prospect by MLB Pipeline. However, his upward trend was slowed from there, as he was forced to undergo Tommy John Surgery in March, but then he did not miss much as the minor league season ended up being cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n Joey was back on the mound in 2021, splitting the year between the Class A Lakeland Flying Tigers and AA Erie. His combined record was 0-7, 4.50 in 18 starts, although he was never allowed to pitch very deep into games, logging just 72 innings, which helps to explain why wins were hard to come by. he did strike out 82 batters, against 64 hits. He reached AAA for the first time at the beginning of the 2022 season, with the Toledo Mud Hens. He was 0-1, 4.12 after 5 starts when he was called up to Detroit on May 10th, pencilled in as the starting the pitcher against the Oakland Athletics the following day. That outing did not go great, as in 2 2/3 innings, he allowed 6 runs on 7 hits and 2 walks and was charged with a 9-0 loss."},

He went 0-2, 6.06 in 4 games, including 3 starts. He then spent all of 2019 in Detroit's starting rotation, where he was in effect a victim of his success: because he was one of the most reliable starters on a last-place team that had trouble putting runs on the scoreboard, he ended up on the losing end of the decision more often than should normally have been the case. In fact, in 30 starts, he went 3-17, in spite of a decent 4.61 ERA - which was in fact good for an ERA+ of 102 - leading the American League in both losses and hit batsmen (16). With an almost identical ERA - 4.56 - teammate Matthew Boyd, who led the Tigers in starts, innings pitched and strikeouts, ended up with a record of 9-12, but then Daniel Norris was at 3-13 with an ERA of 4.49 and Jordan Zimmermann, whose ERA was in a different zip code at 6.91, finished 1-13. Spencer did manage to strike out 146 batters in 148 1/3 innings.\n In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he managed to top the previous year's victory total in just 11 starts, finishing at 4-4 with an ERA of 3.97, as he continued to improve. On May 18, 2021, he acquired the status of elite pitcher when he became the fifth pitcher of the season to throw a 9-inning no-hitter, following Joe Musgrove, Carlos Rodon, John Means and Wade Miley. He defeated the Seattle Mariners, 5-0, while striking out 9 batters. It was both the first complete game and shutout of his career as he improved to 3-2, 2.88 on the year. The very next day, Corey Kluber of the New York Yankees also pitched a no-hitter."},

His selection was expected, as he had established as one of the top prospects in the nation months before the draft, and the fact that the coronavirus pandemic put a stop to all amateur baseball competitions in March simply consolidated his position, as there was no opportunity for other candidates to emerge before the draft. Tigers scouting director Scott Pleis explained the Tigers' choice thus: \"Spencer is exactly the type of player we hoped would be there for us with the top pick in this year’s Draft. He’s one of the most polished hitters we’ve seen in the Draft for quite some time, showing plus-plus power and excellent plate discipline.\"\n Torkelson made his mark at Arizona State University as a top slugger, hitting 25 homers as a freshman in 2018, crushing the school record for most homers by a player in his first season, set by Barry Bonds in 1983 and which was 11. He hit 23 more in 2019 and had already hit 6 in 17 games when the college baseball season was canceled in 2020. He was a two-time semi-finalist for the Golden Spikes Award. He was a first baseman in college, and sometimes outfielder, although the Tigers announced him as a third baseman (he slid back to playing first base in the pros, however). Scouts compared him to Mark Teixeira as a power-hitting first baseman who should reach the majors quickly. He was the first right-handed hitting first baseman to be taken with the top pick. Surprisingly, he had not been drafted when he had graduated from high school in 2017. That said, he was already a sensation in Little League in his hometown of Petaluma, CA, when he blasted a record 36 homers in his final season. He worked with private batting instructor Joey Gomes, the brother of Jonny Gomes and a tutor to a number of top draft picks, to improve his swing, starting when he was 12 years old.\n He was signed by the Tigers on June 30th and was immediately added to the team's 60-player pool for the upcoming season, the option of assigning him to the minor leagues not being available. His signing bonus was $8,416,300. He went to major league spring training in 2021, then was assigned to the West Michigan Whitecaps of the new High-A Central league when the minor league season began in May. He played 31 games there before receiving his first promotion, moving up to the Erie SeaWolves of the Double-A Northeast, then after 50 games received a final promotion, to the Toledo Mud Hens of Triple-A East. While his batting average went down at each level, he still hit .267/.383/.552 in 121 games, with 29 double and 30 homers. He also drew 77 walks, scored 89 runs and drove in 91. He also played in the 2021 Futures Game.\n He was one of the big centers of attention at the Tigers spring training in 2022 and on April 2nd, the team confirmed that he ahd made the Opening Day roster. He was likely to start the bulk of games at first base, with Miguel Cabrera being relegated to DH duties and was to become the first Tigers player to make his major league debut as a starting player on Opening Day since Austin Jackson and Scott Sizemore in 2010. It took him until his fifth game to get his first major league hit, and it came against Rich Hill of the Boston Red Sox in the 3rd inning on August 12th. He came around to score his first career run shortly afterwards. He did not have to wait too long for his first homer, as it came the next day, off Austin Davis of Boston, with a runner on base. Overall, however, it was a rough first season for Torkelson as he struggled to a .203 average in 110 games, with 8 homers and 28 RBIs for an OPS+ of 74. The going got so tough at one point that he was sent back to Toledo for 35 games in order to regain his strike, but he did not do much better in AAA, batting .229 with 5 homers and 18 RBIs.\n Torkelson had a much better sophomore season with the Tigers in 2023 as he matched the previous year's home run total of 8 on June 19th. He hit 7 homers in June alone, although that was while batting just .196, but by August he was finally hitting the way that had been expected ever since he had been drafted first overall.\n On the personal side, he is apparently a friend of Food Network host Guy Fieri, who tweeted his support for him way back in 2019, when Torkelson made the cover of Baseball America as the top slugging prospect in the amateur ranks. Torkelson's mother is the Chief Financial Officer for Fieri's businesses, and the chef has known the budding slugger since he was in high school."},

In 2017, he began the season in the Florida State League with the Tampa Yankees, for whom he played 100 games, then was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the AA Eastern League for an additional 30 games. Between the two stops, his batting line was .297/.384/.452, with 72 runs, 26 doubles, 12 homes and 53 RBIs.\n On February 20, 2018, just after the opening of spring training, he was traded by the Yankees first to the Arizona Diamondbacks along with P Taylor Widener in return for 2B/3B Brandon Drury, then immediately to the Tampa Bay Rays along with P Anthony Banda and two players to be named later (Sam McWilliams and Colin Poche) in return for OF Steven Souza. The Rays had suddenly decided, as spring training opened, to shed some salary and Souza was the third veteran to be dealt by the team in the span of four days in return for prospects. He spent the season with the Montgomery Biscuits in the Southern League where he hit .282/.384/.450 in 126 games, with 19 homers and 76 RBIs. He played a lot of outfield in addition to second base that season. In 2019, he started the year in AAA with the Durham Bulls, where he hit .266 with 17 homers and 47 RBIs in 85 games.

On August 9th, he had a homer taken away from him by the official scorer. Against the Los Angeles Angels, he hit a drive into the right field corner, which bounced in an out of RF Jo Adell's glove and over the fence, allowing him to circle the bases. The official scorer reversed his initial decision of giving him credit for a homer, however, as he ruled that the ball would not have cleared the fence were it not for Adell's assistance, and that it was catchable with ordinary effort. It was the first four-base error in a major league game in over five years."},

Fellow future major leaguer Jurickson Profar was also a member of the team.\n Schoop was signed by scout Ernst Meyer for the Baltimore Orioles in August 2008. He hit .239/.320/.291 as a rookie with the 2009 DSL Orioles, stealing 11 bases in 14 tries. He fielded .944 at shortstop. The next year, he bounced between the GCL Orioles (.250/.329/.467 in 17 G), Bluefield Orioles (.316/.372/.459 in 39 G) and Frederick Keys (5 for 21, 3 2B, BB). He fielded .929 in 55 games at short that season. At year's end, Baseball America named him the #10 Orioles prospect. \n In 2011, he was used as a utility infielder by Frederick (.271/.329/.375 in 77 G) and the Delmarva Shorebirds (.316/.376/.514 in 51 G), with 13 home runs and 82 runs between the two clubs. Baseball America rated him as the #9 South Atlantic League prospect (between Brandon Jacobs and fellow Dutch citizen Xander Bogaerts) and the #6 Carolina League prospect (behind Manny Machado, Drew Pomeranz, Mike Olt, fellow Dutch citizen Andrelton Simmons and Robbie Erlin). In the 2011 Futures Game, he replaced Jose Altuve as the second base for the World team in the 6th inning; he formed a double play tandem with former Little League World Series teammate Jurickson Profar. In his lone plate appearance in the contest, he singled off Kyle Gibson in the 7th but was picked off. \n He then made the Dutch national team roster for the 2011 Baseball World Cup; though still a teenager, he was not even the youngest infielder on the roster, as Bogaerts made it at age 18. One of his teammates on the club was his brother Sharlon. He got into regular action after starting third baseman Vince Rooi was injured early in the Cup. Jonathan wound up hitting 6th or 7th after his brother Sharlon. Schoop struggled offensively on the tourney, hitting .184/.225/.263, which was actually better than Sharlon posted. Jonathan did field well, with 14 putouts, 11 assists and no errors. He also had some clutch plays. In a 7-5 upset of Team USA (the defending champs), Jonathan hit a three-run triple off Matt Shoemaker. Against Australia, he threw out a runner at home in a 2-1 win. In the Gold Medal game against Cuba, he came to bat in the 4th with one out and a 1-1 tie facing Freddy Asiel Alvarez. Schoop singled in Curt Smith with the last run of the Gold Medal game, helping the Netherlands win Gold for the first time ever at a Baseball World Cup. \n Schoop's prospect status took a hit in 2012 as he hit .245/.324/.386 with 14 home runs for the Bowie Baysox. He also was now primarily a second baseman rather than a shortstop. Baseball America ranked him as the Eastern League's #14 prospect, between Mike Kickham and Rob Brantly. He was the starter at second for the Netherlands in the 2013 World Baseball Classic and hit .214/.313/.464 with 6 RBI in 8 games. His 2-run homer off Dushan Ruzic capped the Orange's 4-1 win over Australia. Against Cuba, he again starred, getting 3 hits and 4 RBI in the first match-up, each hit a big one. His single knocked out Cuban starter Ismel Jiménez, his 3-run homer off Yadier Pedroso built a one-run lead into a four-run cushion and his RBI double off Yander Guevara scored Simmons with the game's last run of a 6-2 victory. In the Netherlands' semifinal game, he hit 7th and went 0 for 4, striking out against Fernando Rodney to end the team's historic run to the final round. He tied Simmons for the team lead in home runs (2) and RBI in the tournament, beating out noted sluggers like Andruw Jones and Wladimir Balentien. Overall, he tied for 9th in the Classic in RBI and tied Shinnosuke Abe, Robinson Cano, Chris Colabello, Hanley Ramirez, Carlos Santana, Simmons and Yasmany Tomas for third in home runs (one behind José Dariel Abreu and Alfredo Despaigne. On the downside, his 8 whiffs tied Edwin Encarnacion and Alejandro De Aza for the tournament lead. \n He continued to disappoint in the minors, showing decent pop (9 HR in 270 AB) for the 2013 Norfolk Tides but posting just a .256/.301/.396 line with 13 walks. He missed significant time with a back injury as well.\n Schoop had a great major league debut for the Orioles on September 25, 2013, making a start at second base one day after the Birds were eliminated from contention for a wild card spot. Hitting 8th against the Toronto Blue Jays, he singled off Esmil Rogers in the 3rd inning in his first career at-bat, then came home to score on Ryan Flaherty's homer; he grounded into an inning-ending double play in the 4th but led off the 6th with a homer off Kyle Drabek, then walked against Ricky Romero to lead off the 8th, scoring his third run on Flaherty's second long ball of the contest. Thus, he finished his first day in the bigs 2 for 3 with 3 runs scored and an RBI as the Orioles won, 9-5. He went 4 for 14 in 5 games. In 2014, he played 137 games in his rookie season, but hit only .209 with 16 homers and 45 RBIs. His biggest Achilles' heel was his plate discipline as he walked only 13 times against 122 strikeouts. The Orioles had a great season, winning a division title, and he went 3 for 10 in the Orioles' sweep of the Detroit Tigers in the Division Series. However, the Birds ran into a very hot Kansas City Royals team in the ALCS, being swept as Jonathan went 1 for 11.\n In 2015, Schoop was limited to 86 games but made some significance improvement, hitting .279 with 15 homers and 39 RBIs. His OPS+ was the best indicator of his progress, having gone from a very poor 65 as a rookie to a very good 111. He still had trouble controlling the strike zone, though, with 79 Ks and only 9 walks. In 2016, he played all 162 games for the Orioles and set personal bests with 38 doubles and 25 homers, to go along with a .267 batting average, 82 runs and as many RBI. He still had trouble getting on base regularly, with only 21 walks, for an OBP of .298. In the Wild Card Game which the Orioles lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in extra innings, he went 0 for 4.\n Schoop played for the Dutch national team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, his second appearance in the tournament. In 2017, he made the All-Star team for the first time. That season, he set a new record for RBIs by an Orioles second baseman. The previous mark had been 94, by Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar in 1996. He finished the year with 105, to go along with a .293 average, 35 doubles, 32 homers and 92 runs scored in 160 games in what was his best season up to that point. However, he started 2018 slowly and after 85 games, he was hitting .244 with 17 homers and 40 RBIs when he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on July 31st in return for Jonathan Villar and two prospects, Jean Carmona and Luis Ortiz. He was just coming off a great month, having hit .360 with 9 homers in July, but the Orioles were conducting a veritable fire sale at the trade deadline after an awful first four months. Jonathan failed to shine with the Brewers, however, hitting just .202 in 46 games over the rest of the season. He was no longer a starter when the postseason started, with the Brewers having moved Travis Shaw over from third to second, taking a defensive hit to improve the offense. He was hitless in the two series the Brewers played, making just one unconvincing start in their loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. Following the season, the Brewers failed to offer him a new contract, making him a free agent.\n On December 6, 2018, he signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Twins worth $7.5 million. Like the Orioles, the Twins had also traded their starting second baseman, Brian Dozier, at the trading deadline the previous year. He was part of a record-breaking offensive collection with the Twins in 2019, as the team bounced back from its disappointing previous season to threaten the all-time record for home runs by a team. Schoop did his part by reaching the 20-homer mark for the fourth time on August 28th as part of a two-homer game in an 8-2 win over the Chicago White Sox. He became the 7th Twins player to reach the mark that season, tying the major league mark shared by seven other teams. He finished the season at .256 in 121 games, with 23 homers and 59 RBIs, but lost playing time down the stretch with the arrival of rookie Luis Arraez, who hit .334 and was a nice contrast on a team full of low-average power hitters. Arraez was the starter at second base in the postseason, when the Twins made a quick exit when swept in three games by the New York Yankees in the Division Series. Schoop had only 2 at-bats in the series and it was no surprise that he was granted free agency after the season. On December 21st, he signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Tigers for $6.1 million, on the same day as Twins teammate 1B C.J. Cron, who had put up very similar numbers also in his single season in Minnesota, and who signed for exactly the same amount.\n Schoop turned out to be one of the better players on the Tigers in 2020 as one of a small number of productive veterans on a rebuilding squad. In 44 games in the pandemic-shortened season, he hit .278 with 8 homers and 23 RBIs, also scoring 26 runs, for an OPS+ of 115. It was supposed to be a one-year thing, but when the free agent market largely cratered after the season, given the economic uncertainties resulting from the pandemic, Schoop was unable to turn his productive season into a more stable deal and on February 5, 2021 he decided to return to the Tigers, and to do so took a pay cut, signing for $4.5 million. The Tigers were still looking to go with youth, but could not pass up such a bargain, knowing that it was useful to also have a few productive players with some years of experience to help nurture along the kids."},

He had time to play two more games that season, with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Florida State League, and ended up with a combined line of .261/.350/.467 in 112 games. Meanwhile, Verlander's acquisition helped propel the Astros to their first-ever World Series title that same year.\n In 2018, Rogers spent a full season with the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League. His batting average fell to .219 in 99 games, but he still showed good power with 15 doubles and 17 homers, drove in 56 runs and drew 41 walks. He mainly drew attention for his defensive play, though, as he was considered by many to be top defensive catcher in the affiliated minor leagues that year. After the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League but he hit just .167 in 13 games while competing against some of the top prospects in all of organized baseball. He was named to the roster of the American League team for the 2019 Futures Game."},

Despite a commitment to Clemson University, he signed for a bonus of more than $3 million and made his pro debut with the GCL Pirates on July 9th, going 0-for-5 but scoring 2 runs against the GCL Yankees. He also played for the Jamestown Jammers of the New York-Penn League that first season and hit a combined .316/.424/.554 in 48 games, with 11 doubles, 5 triples and 7 homers.\n Given his high draft status and excellent maiden season, Pirates fans expected to make it to Pittsburgh in short order, but his minor league apprenticeship ended up taking more time than expected. An injury limited him to 45 game sin 2014, but he continued to hit very well, as his batting line was .317/.394/.488, mainly with the West Virginia Power of the South Atlantic League. In 2015, he had another solid season with the Bradenton Marauders of the Florida State League, where he hit .307/.357/.407 in 121 games. The Pirates rewarded him by giving him a late-season look in AA with the Altoona Curve and he responded by hitting .360 with 5 extra-base hits in 6 games. His 2016 season was curtailed by an injury again, however, but he hit well for Altoona, at .311/.365/.611 in 45 games. That outstanding slugging percentage was the result of 16 doubles, 8 triples and 6 homers in just 167 at-bats. He was promoted to AAA for the first time, lining up with the Indianapolis Indians, but hit just .214 in 37 games there, although he continued to hit for a lot of power, with 16 long hits, 7 of them homers. He should normally have been in line for a September call-up, but it didn't happen.\n Austin started off the 2017 season with Indianapolis and in 72 games hit .250 with 4 homers and 36 RBIs. He again missed some time due to an injury and made a couple of stints on rehabilitation assignments in the lower minors. The injuries that slowed his progression were oblique and hamstring strains, not issues that created longer-term concerns, but they were obviously frustrating for Meadows. So, his debut was again pushed back. In 2018, he was again at Indianapolis when the season opened. After 32 games, he was hitting .294, although without having really shown the very impressive power he had displayed in previous years, as he had 10 doubles, no triples and just one homer at that point. Still, on May 17th, the Pirates announced he would be called up to the Show the next day, following an injury to CF Starling Marte. In his debut on May 18th, he recorded his first two hits and also had a stolen base in a 3-2 loss to the San Diego Padres. He started the game in center field and hit 7th. He added his first homer two days later, off Jordan Lyles. The plan was originally for him to go down when Marte came off the 10-day DL, but he was playing so well, they sent down Jose Osuna instead and rotated Meadows into the outfield mix with Marte, Corey Dickerson and Gregory Polanco. Even though he was only present for half the month, he was named the National League Rookie of the Month for May, on the strength of a .409 average, 4 homers, 9 runs and 7 RBIs in 13 games. The Elias Sports Bureau reported that he was only the 5th rookie since 1961 to hit 4+ homers and .400+ in his first 40 at-bats, alongside Albert Pujols, Jeff Francoeur, Brian Giles and Yasiel Puig. After 49 games, he was hitting .292 with 5 homers and 13 RBIs when on July 31st he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays along with P Tyler Glasnow and a player to be named later in return for P Chris Archer. He only played 10 games for Tampa, hitting .250, being called up in late September after spending six weeks with the Durham Bulls in AAA. He finished at .287 in 59 games, with 6 homers and 17 RBIs.\n In 2019, he earned a starting spot in right field with the Rays in spring training and began the season by hitting .351 in 21 games in April. He followed that by hitting .356 in May, and even though he slumped in June, it was enough to earn him his first berth on the All-Star team. He continued to produce in the second half and was at his best in September when he hit .378 with 9 homers and 20 RBIs in 24 games to be named the American League Player of the Month. He finished the season with a .291 average, 29 doubles, 33 homers, 83 runs and 89 RBIs in 138 games to help the Rays qualify for the postseason for the first time since 2013. He went 0 for 3 with a walk as Tampa Bay defeated the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Game, and then 3 for 20 with a pair of doubles as the Rays extended the heavily-favored Houston Astros to the limit in the Division Series.\n Just when the Rays were popular picks to take advantage of the abbreviated season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, he was placed on the injured list on July 16, 2020 after testing positive for the virus. He had already missed the previous 13 days of summer camp after attending the first day of workouts. He made his debut on August 4th and ended up playing 36 of the Rays' 60 games, hitting .205 with an .296 OBP, 4 homers and 13 RBIs. His OPS+ fell to 87. But the Rays had plenty of other weapons and had the best record in the American League that season, then made it all the way to the World Series. He did not appear in the Wild card Series, and batted below .200 in the three next rounds although he did hit a pair of homers in the Division Series against the New York Yankees. In the World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, he went just 3 for 16, without a walk and all three hits being singles.\n Austin bounced back to some extent in 2021 after that disappointing season. He played a career-high 142 games and while he batted just .234, he did enough other things to raise his OPS+ to a solid 117. He hit 29 doubles and 27 homers, drove in a team-high 106 runs, while his 79 runs scored were third on the Rays, who won 100 games. He split his time between left field and designated hitter. But for the second straight year, his postseason numbers were a disappointment: he played just 3 of the 5 games in the Division Series, and went 2 for 9, although both hits went for extra bases (a double and a homer). He scored one run and drive in three as the Rays were upset by the Boston Red Sox. By spring training in 2022, his stock had fallen significantly on the Rays, who had what was considered to be the strongest farm system in the majors, with a lot of youngsters biding for playing time. On April 4th, the Rays decided to cash in on his remaining value by trading him to the Detroit Tigers in return for infielder Isaac Paredes and a Competitive Round B pick in the 2022 amateur draft. The Tigers had an immediate need for an outfielder following a right foot fracture to top prospect Riley Greene, who had just won a starting job in the outfield. However, it turned out to be a very difficult season for Meadows. He went on the injured list on May 16th because of vertigo, at which point he was hitting .267 but without a homer and 11 RBIs in 28 games. He returned in early June, played another 8 games without a homer or RBI, and returned to the IL on June 17th, his season over. He was set back by a series of problems, including being infected by COVID-19, an Achilles heel issue and later mental health issues as the toll of constantly rehabbing got to him. He made an announcement in early September that he would not return that season in order to work on those mental issues.\n He was in the Tigers' line-up for Opening Day in 2023, starting in left field against the Tampa Bay Rays on March 30th and going 3 for 4 in a 4-0 loss. However, his health issues soon caught up with him again, and on April 8th, after playing 6 games and going 5 for 21, he went on the injured list in order to focus on his mental health, with the full support of his team.\n Austin's younger brother, Parker Meadows, was selected by the Detroit Tigers with the first pick of the second round (#44 overall) in the 2018 amateur draft. He reached the majors with the Tigers in August of 2023 while Austin was on the injured list, but the two had played together for the first time in spring training that year."},

He was drafted in the 33rd round of the 2016 Amateur Draft.  \n His 2016 and 2017 seasons in the minors were not particularly notable as his batting averages were in the general range of .250 and he showed little home run power. 2018, however, marked the start of more impressive play with batting averages over .300 for two of the teams he played for, and he showed somewhat more power. In 2019, after playing most of the season with the Tulsa Drillers, and posting a line of .279/.352/.455, he came up to Oklahoma City for 26 games, hitting .382 and slugging .753.\n Defensively in the minors, most of his games have been at second base, third base and shortstop, in that order. This ability to play middle infield undoubtedly helped him make the Dodgers' roster as Dodgers infielder/outfielder Kiké Hernandez was likely to become a free agent at the end of the 2020 season. He joined the Dodgers near the end of the season, and appeared in 4 games, going 2-for-7 with the bat for a .286 average. Defensively, most of his innings were in right field. He did replace Hernandez on the roster at the start of the 2021 season and in the team's third game, on April 3rd, he had the honor of hitting the Dodgers' first home run of the season. It came as a pinch-hitter in the 8th innings against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, and was an inside-the-park homer. LF Raimel Tapia managed to keep the ball from leaving the park, but hurt himself as he banged the fence doing so, and by the time he could recover the ball and relay it back to the infield, McKinstry had circled the bases. Interestingly, the last Dodgers player to have his his first career homer inside-the-park was none other than future Hall of Famer Duke Snider, way back in 1948. He hit .215 in 60 games that year, with 7 homers and 29 RBIs. He did not appear in the postseason.\n Zach spent most of the first half of 2022 in the minor leagues, only appearing in 10 games for L.A., with his only hit in 11 at-bats being a homer. On July 30th, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs in return for reliever Chris Martin."},

The 104th overall selection, the pick was compensation for the loss of A.J. Burnett to free agency. He made his pro debut the following summer with the GCL Blue Jays and hit .287/.373/.459 in 35 games then was promoted to the Lansing Lugnuts, for whom he batted only .220/.298/.339 in 34 contests. Overall, he had 23 steals in 26 tries and registered 8 outfield assists. Baseball America named him the top athlete in the Jays system and as the #4 prospect in the Gulf Coast League (behind Gary Sanchez, Miguel Sano and Justin O'Conner.\n He spent most of 2011 with the Lansing Lugnuts, hitting .320/.392/.496 with 14 home runs, 77 RBIs, and 37 stolen bases (in 45 tries), and was a Midwest League All-Star (joining Rymer Liriano and Michael Crouse in the outfield). He was second in the MWL in average (.006 behind Josh Whitaker), 4th in OBP, 8th in slugging (between David Vidal and Donald Lutz), 4th in OPS, 3rd in hits (148, behind Nick Castellanos and Billy Hamilton), 7th in RBI (between Derek Dietrich and Castellanos), tied for 4th in total bases (229, even with Lutz) and 6th in steals. He was rated the third-best MWL prospect by Baseball America, behind Taijuan Walker and Hamilton, and as the best athlete in the Jays chain by the same publication.\n Marisnick's performance fell off in 2012, though. He split time between the Dunedin Blue Jays (.263/.349/.451 in 65 G)) and New Hampshire Fisher Cats (.233/.286/.336 in 55 G), with only 8 home runs, 50 RBI and 24 steals in 33 tries. He did leg out 10 triples, tying Anthony Gose for the lead in the Toronto chain. He hit .314 for Salt River in the Arizona Fall League following the season. Baseball America still rated him very highly - as the best defensive outfield and having the best outfield arm in the Toronto minors, as the #2 Toronto prospect (after Aaron Sanchez), as the #64 prospect in the minors, as the 11th-best Florida State League prospect (between Jesse Biddle and Adam Morgan) and as the #9 Eastern League prospect (between Aaron Hicks and Tommy Joseph).\n He was dealt to the Miami Marlins as part of a 12-player trade, sent along with Yunel Escobar, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Alvarez, Jeff Mathis, Justin Nicolino and Anthony Descalafani for Mark Buehrle, John Buck, Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson and Emilio Bonifacio. After being injured at the start of 2013, he played three games with the Class A Jupiter Hammerheads before joining the Jacksonville Suns of the AA Southern League. He hit .295/.357/.504 in 66 games, with 13 doubles, 12 homers and 46 RBI to earn a call-up to Miami on July 22nd. he made his big league debut the next day, starting in center field and batting 6th for the Marlins against the Colorado Rockies. However, it was teammate Christian Yelich, who was also making his debut in left field, who stole the show that night. Yelich went 3 for 4 while Marisnick was shut out in 4 at-bats in the Marlins' 4-2 win. In his first at-bat, he was retired by Jhoulys Chacin on a grounder. He had to wait until his fourth game to collect his first hit, a single off Jeff Locke of the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 26th; he had started his career 0 for 14. He ended up hitting .183 in 40 games, with 1 homer and 5 RBI.\n He returned to the minors at the start of the 2014 season, hitting .277 in 89 games with the New Orleans Zephyrs in his first taste of AAA ball. He hit 16 doubles and 10 homers, during his stint there, scored 50 runs and drove in 40. He was called up briefly to Miami in June, but only went 8 for 48 (.167) with no extra-base hits. On July 31st, he was involved in the second big trade of his young career, being sent to the Houston Astros along with Colin Moran and Francis Martes in return for two major leaguers - P Jarred Cosart and IF/OF Enrique Hernandez - and minor leaguer Austin Wates. he played 51 games for Houston the rest of the way, hitting .272 with 3 homers and 19 RBIs. In 2015, he was the team's most used centerfielder, playing 133 games while hitting .236 with 9 doubles and 36 RBIs. On May 7th, he completed an unassisted double play in the 4th inning of a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, snagging a line drive off the bat of Matt Joyce and then tagging Albert Pujols who had ventured too far off first base. Because of his relatively weak bat, he lost his starting job to late-season acquisition Carlos Gomez and did not start the Wild Card Game against the New York Yankees on October 6th. He came on as a defensive replacement in centerfield for Gomez in the bottom of the 9th. With Gomez having health issues, Jake got to make two starts in center against the Kansas City Royals in the Division Series and went 3 for 7 overall.\n In 2016, he played 116 games for the Astros, hitting .209 with 5 homers and 21 RBIs. The Astros were concerned with his lack of production with the bat, and while they loved his defensive play in center, he was confined to a back-up role in 2017. On July 31st, however, he had a career game against the Tampa Bay Rays, hitting 2 homers and driving 5 runs to lead Houston to a 14-7 win. He did his damage hitting out of the 9th spot, which is where he usually batted on the occasions when he was starting games in centerfield. On September 13th, he broke his right thumb while sliding into second base headfirst against the Angels. The injury meant that he would be out for six to eight weeks, meaning he would not be back during the regular season, although there was a possibility of seeing him return if the Astros went deep in the postseason. He was hitting .243 in 106 games, with a career-high 16 homers and 35 RBIs. His 50 runs scored and 20 walks were also personal bests, and his OPS+ of 121 was well above anything he had put up previously. This made him an important - if uncelebrated - cog on the team. Luckily for them, the Astros had acquired another centerfielder, Cameron Maybin, just before the cut-off date for players to be eligible for the postseason. He ended up missing the entire postseason, as the Astros won the first Championship in team history.\n In 2018, he began the season mired in a deep slump. On May 16th, he was hitting just .141 in 34 games when he was sent down to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies. He returned after a week, but it took him a while to lift his average above the Mendoza Line, only doing so on August 1st, after missing the second half of July. he finished the season at .211 in 103 games, with 10 homers and 28 RBIs. He was used as a defensive substitute in the postseason, getting only 3 at-bats in two series as the Astros were were eliminated by the Boston Red Sox at the ALCS stage.\n On the last day before the All-Star break, on July 7, 2019 he was involved in a violent collision at home plate with C Jonathan Lucroy of the Los Angeles Angels as he was attempting to score on a shallow sacrifice fly in the 8th inning with the score 10-10. He barreled into the catcher, sending him crashing backwards to the ground with a broken nose and a concussion. Lucroy had to be carted off the field. The umpire disallowed the run as he judged that Marisnick had made no attempt to avoid a collision. Yadier Molina for one weighed in after the incident, saying that Marisnick should be suspended, something with which Angels manager Brad Ausmus, himself a former catcher, agreed. On July 11th, he received a two-game suspension for his part in the collision. He was coming off a solid first half, in which he had hit .250 with 8 homers and 24 RBIs, good for an OPS+ of 103. On July 16th, he was hit by a pitch from the Angels' Noe Ramirez, a gesture which manager A.J. Hinch denounced as having been deliberate retaliation for the collision and which, in his view, should have resulted in Ramirez being ejected from the game. The next day, Ramirez was handed a three-game suspension for his gesture. Marisnick finished the season at .233 in 120 games, with 10 homers and 34 RBIs, his value being primarily defensive. In the postseason, he went 4 for 11 as the Astros made it to Game 7 of the World Series before bowing to the Washington Nationals.\n On December 5, 2019, he was traded to the New York Mets in return for two prospects, Kenedy Corona and Blake Taylor. The Mets wanted to make him their starting centerfielder in 2020, in place of Juan Lagares who had left via free agency. However, he played just 16 games for the Mets during the pandemic-shortened season, hitting.333 with 2 homers and 5 RBIs. He spent a month on the injured list, from late July to late August, with a hamstring pull, and another week in September with tightness in the other hamstring. After the season, he became a free agent. He signed with the Chicago Cubs on February 20, 2021 and hit .227 in 65 games with 5 homers and 22 RBIs. On July 30th, he was traded to the San Diego Padres in return for P Anderson Espinoza as part of the Cubs' fire sale of veteran players."},

He began his professional career that year with the GCL Tigers West, going 0-2 3.99 in 10 games, but logging just 29 1/3 innings as the Tigers were treating him carefully. He also saw limited action in 2017, making a total of 14 starts and pitching 51 innings between the Connecticut Tigers of the New York-Penn League and the West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League. He was 4-2, 3.18 and struck out 52 batters.\n In 2018, he pitched for three teams, starting at West Michigan and earning promotions to the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Florida State League and then to the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League, the latter for just 2 games. Overall, he went 7-8, 3.29 in 22 starts with an outstanding 154 strikeouts in 117 2/3 innings. He was selected to pitch for the United States team in the 2018 Futures Game and for the American League in the 2019 Futures Game.\n He made his major league debut in June of 2021, after being forced to sit out the 2020 season when the minor leagues were cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. He had started 2021 with the AAA Toledo Mud Hens, going 1-3, 8.07 in 7 starts. In spite of these less than sparkling numbers, he spent the remainder of the season with Detroit, making 18 starts and going 4-7, 5.80. In 85 1/3 innings, he gave up 96 hits and 33 walks, and also struck out 57 batters. In 2022, injuries limited him to 12 major league starts, in addition to 7 others in the minors. He was 1-1, 2.42 in AA and AAA and 2-3, 3.43 in the majors, showing signs of significant improvement.\n On July 8, 2023, he pitched the first 6 2/3 innings of a combined no-hitter by the Tigers against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was replaced by Jason Foley after making 91 pitches and walking three batters. Foley completed the inning and pitched another one, after which Alex Lange retired the Jays in order in the 9th to complete the feat. Since the Tigers had scored both of their runs in the 2-0 win in the bottom of the 1st, he was credited with the win. In just his second start of that season, on April 11th, he had been injured by a comebacker through the mound hit by Toronto's Alejandro Kirk and had been out until the end of June, following a few games in the minors on a rehabilitation assignment at Toledo. He gave up no earned runs in 8 2/3 innings spread out over three starts in AAA. On September 6th, his season came to a premature end when he was again hit by a batted ball, this time on the right foot off the bat of the New York Yankees' Giancarlo Stanton, a hit measured at 119.5 mph. The impact caused a fracture and he had to leave the game after managing to throw out Stanton at first base to end the 1st inning. In 15 starts in the majors, he went 5-4, 3.58, logging 78 innings.\n His father, Rich Manning, played two seasons in the NBA. Matt played more basketball than baseball as a youngster and only began pitching in high school. However, his excellent athleticism allowed him to progress very fast in spite of his lack of pitching experience."},

He was then taken by the Cincinnati Reds in the supplemental first round of the 2013 amateur draft. At Cal State-Fullerton, he was mainly a power-hitting outfielder, but he was also used as the team's closer his senior year, and it was as a pitcher that the Reds drafted him. Not only that, but they had plans to turn him into a starter, even though he had only pitched a total of 44 innings in college.\n He made his pro debut the summer he was drafted, with the AZL Reds on July 3rd, the first of four abbreviated stops he would make that first season. He was 1-1, 3.00, pitching 21 innings in 22 outings. It took him less than two years to make it to the big leagues, following an excellent second year, in which he put up a 3.13 ERA in 120 2/3 innings as a starter for the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the AA Southern League; his record was only 4-6, because the Reds were understandably reluctant to let him pitch deep into games, but everything else was positive. \n He was invited to the Reds' spring training in 2015 and almost made the team's starting rotation. In the end, he was sent down to the AAA Louisville Bats to start the year but was called up to the Queen City after only three starts, when Homer Bailey went down for the year. He made his debut facing the Milwaukee Brewers on April 29th, and did pretty well, even though he allowed solo homers to Adam Lind, Khris Davis and Ryan Braun: he gave up no other runs in 5 innings, struck out 5 and only walked one, and even got his first big league hit, a solid single to right off Matt Garza in his first at-bat. Unfortunately, he left trailing 3-2, and his bullpen blew the game open, leaving him charged with an 8-3 loss. He went 4-9, 5.40 in 27 games, including 21 starts, logging 113 1/3 innings.\n He was moved to the bullpen full-time in 2016 and on August 19th did something quite rare in this day and age: he homered as a relief pitcher. He had entered the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 7th inning, then in the bottom of the frame came up to bat against Pedro Baez and went deep with two men on in a 9-2 win. The blast came in Lorenzen's first game after he had left the team for nine days to be at his dying father's bedside. He made 35 appearances, all in relief, that season, going 2-1, 2.88 in 50 innings.\n While Lorenzen's first career home run was a tribute to his late father, the relationship between the two was far from perfect. Clif Lorenzen was an alcoholic and a violent man who had deserted Michael's family when he was 12 in order to escape pending grand theft and forgery charges. It was not an easy relationship, but Michael eventually forgave his dad his failings. His older brother Jonathan Lorenzen was the first to make his mark in baseball, being drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers and playing briefly in their organization. That came just before his father skipped town for good. With his mother needing to work a late shift to make ends meet, Michael turned into a self-described \"young punk\", smoking copious amounts of weed and doing various stupid things. His brother wasted his baseball potential by being caught having sexual relations with an underage girl at the Dodgers' spring training complex, earning him jail time and ending his baseball career, before he eventually got his life back into control. For Michael, the turning point came at 17, when he found religion and was able to vanquish his personal demons. He worked with new dedication to fulfill his baseball talent, eventually earning a scholarship to Cal State-Fullerton.\n On April 6, 2017, Michael once again made the news for hitting a home run. This one came as a pinch-hitter against Adam Morgan of the Philadelphia Phillies and broke a 4-4 tie in the 6th inning, propelling the Reds to a win. The team had started the season with only four bench players and manager Bryan Price had mentioned that he would use Lorenzen to pinch-hit on days when he was not available to pitch. That is exactly what happened, as he had appeared in his team's previous two games. He was the first pitcher to blast a pinch homer since Chris Owings had done so on May 10, 2009, also for the Reds. He recorded his first career save on April 15th when he pitched the 9th inning of a 7-5 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, the fifth Reds reliever of the game after Brandon Finnegan had to leave the game in the 1st inning because of a strained back muscle. He went 8-4, 4.45 in 70 appearances that season, with 2 saves and 83 innings pitched. \n In 2018, he again made the news with his bat, as he homered in three consecutive at-bats: the first came as a pinch-hitter on June 24th, then he repeated the feat as a pitcher on June 29th and the following day capped things off with a pinch grand slam off Jacob Barnes of the Milwaukee Brewers in a 12-3 win. It was his fifth plate appearance as a pinch-hitter, and they had resulted in two homers, one hit and a walk. His pitching was not too shabby either, with a 1.93 ERA in 15 games. On August 13th, he played the field for the first time as a major leaguer, logging an inning in RF in a 10-3 loss to the Cleveland Indians while OF Brandon Dixon pitched the 9th. He had a hit in his sole plate appearance in the role. His fourth homer was a controversial one: pitching in relief in a high-scoring game against the Brewers on August 29th, he squared off to bunt with two men on and two strikes against Taylor Williams. Williams threw an inside slider that sent Michael to the ground as he checked his swing, and the ball glanced off his bat. The Brewers argued that he should have been out for bunting foul with two strikes, but umpire Tony Randazzo ruled that it was a regular foul ball and let the at-bat continue; on the next pitch, Lorenzen hit a three-run blast. Alas, the Reds lost that wild game, 13-12, in 10 innings. He finished the year at 4-2, 3.11 with 1 save in 45 games as a pitcher while hitting .290 with 4 homers and 10 RBIs in 31 at-bats.\n Heading into spring training in 2019, the Reds announced that they were looking at Lorenzen as a potential two-way player, in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and that he would get an opportunity to play the outfield. The Reds were looking to use him more as a starter or long reliever to multiply his opportunities to also play the field. He did see regular time in the outfield that year, although never as a starter, and continued to hit well albeit in limited opportunities. On September 4th, however, he went full Babe Ruth as he became the first major leaguer since the Bambino, who had done so on June 13, 1921, to win a game, hit a homer and play centerfield in the same contest. He entered the game against the Philadelphia Philles trying to protect a 5-4 lead in the 7th inning, but gave up a game-tying homer to Jay Bruce. However, José Iglesias put the Reds back in front with a pinch homer in the bottom of the inning, and after Lorenzen had pitched a scoreless 8th, he came to bat in the bottom of the 8th a hit a two-run blast off Blake Parker, his first of the season. Closer Raisel Iglesias came in to pitch the 9th and Michael stayed in the game, playing centerfield, to complete a good day's work. He then capped off the week with the first game-ending hit of his career, a pinch double with two men on and one out in the 9th against T.J. McFarland of the Arizona Diamondbacks that drove in Jose Peraza with the winning run in a 4-3 win. An analyst pointed out that Lorenzen had been out-performing Ohtani over the past two years both on the mound and at the plate, although their usage pattern was quite different, with Lorenzen's exploits with the bat coming in a rather small sample size. He finishes the year at 1-4, 2.92 in 73 appearances, all in relief, and 7 saves while batting .208 with 1 homer and 6 RBIs in 48 at-bats. With all the games in the outfield and as a pinch-runner and pinch-hitter, he appeared in an even 100 games.\n In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he had a more traditional usage patter, appearing in 21 games - 18 on the mound, including 2 starts, and 3 in center field, with 4 pinch-running appearances thrown in. Because a universal DH was used that year, he had only one plate appearance (he was hit by a pitch) and scored a couple of runs. He went 3-1, 4.28 as a pitcher, with 35 strikeouts in 33 2/3 innings. The Reds made it into the postseason thanks to its expansion to eight teams per league, and he got to pitch in both games of the Wild Card Series against the Atlanta Braves, not giving up a run in 2 2/3 innings while striking out 6 opponents. In 2021, he made just 27 appearances on the mound, all in relief, finishing at 1-2, 5.59 with 4 saves. He made a couple of appearances in the outfield but struck out in his only at-bat as it seems that the Reds wanted him to concentrate solely on pitching.\n He became a free agent after the 2021 season and signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels, who were ready to give him the opportunity to start again. While the Angels knew all about two-way players thanks to employing the greatest of them all in Ohtani, they limited him strictly to the mound in 2022 as he did not bat a single time, did not play the field, and was not even used as a pinch-runner. He started the year strong, as after 7 starts on May 21st, he was 5-2 with an ERA of 3.05, but both he and the team as a whole struggled after that. He went on the injured list with a right shoulder strain after losing a July 1st start that evened his record at 6-6, and did not return until September when he made another 5 starts and won two of them, to finish at 8-6, 4.24 in 18 games. His 97 2/3 innings were the most for him since his rookie season in 2015, and his 85 strikeouts matched his career high set in 2019. He was a free agent again at the end of the season and on December 14th signed with the Detroit Tigers on another one-year deal for a salary of $8.5 million. That deal turned out to be a bonanza for the Tigers as Lorenzen had a very solid first half and was the team's sole representative at the 2023 All-Star Game. In 18 starts, he went 5-7, 3.58, logging 105 2/3 innings, just 8 fewer than his career high of 113 1/3 achieved as a rookie in 2015. At the trading deadline, the Tigers cashed in on his unexpected value, sending him to the Philadelphia Phillies in return for IF Hao-Yu Lee. He made his first start for the Phillies against the Miami Marlins on August 3rd and it was excellent as he pitched 8 innings in a 4-2 win. Then, in his first home start for his new team on August 9th, he threw a no-hitter, defeating the Washington Nationals, 7-0. He needed 124 pitches to complete the game, by far the highest total he had ever thrown. He struck out 5 and walked 4. LF Weston Wilson made his major league debut behind him and homered in his first at-bat in the 2nd inning while scoring three runs."},

He was the second player taken by the Cubs in that round, following Brendon Little with the 27th pick; Lange's pick was received from the St. Louis Cardinals in compensation for their having signed OF Dexter Fowler as a free agent. Lange was coming off three solid seasons at Louisiana State University: as a freshman in 2015, he had gone 12-0, 1.97 and was named the Louisville Slugger Freshman Pitcher of the Year and was also named an All-American by Baseball America; as a junior in 2017 he went 10-5, 2.97. All three years, he struck out over a batter per inning. He went to the College World Series in both 2015 and 2017, with LSU reaching the finals the second year before losing to the University of Florida.\n As is often the case with college pitchers coming off a full season of work, Lange started his pro career with a very light workload with the Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League in 2017, with just 9 1/3 innings in 4 starts. In 2018, he went 6-8, 3.74 with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League, pitching 120 1/3 innings in 23 starts. In spite of these pretty good numbers, he was back at with the same team at the start of 2019. Maybe it was the disappointment with repeating a level where he had done well, but the results were atrocious with a 1-9 record and an ERA of 7.36 in 11 starts. The Cubs then decided in June to move him up to AA in spite of that mess, and he did a lot better with the Tennessee Smokies of the Southern League. In 7 starts there, he was 2-3, 3.92. On July 31st, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers along with fellow prospect Paul Richan in return for Nicholas Castellanos, who had been the Tigers' best hitter until then. He finished the year with the Erie Sea Wolves in the Eastern League where he was used exclusively in relief, going 2-1, 3.45 in 9 games, covering 15 2/3 innings. After the season, he pitched in the Arizona Fall League, again strictly as a reliever, as it seemed to be the role to which the Tigers were destining him.\n After spending 2020 at the Tigers' alternate training site, he made his major league debut ten days into the 2021 season, pitching one scoreless inning in relief in an 11-3 loss to the Cleveland Indians.\n On July 8, 2023, he pitched the final inning of a combined no-hitter by the Tigers against the Toronto Blue Jays. Matt Manning had started things off with 6 2/3 hitless innings, and Jason Foley had recorded the next four outs in order before Alex took the mound and also retired the Jays in order to preserve the no-hitter and a 2-0 win."},

He began his pro career that year with the Johnson City Cardinals of the Appalachian League and began to move up the organizational ladder slowly but steadily over the next few seasons. In 2016 he took some major steps forward, playing for the first time at AA, AAA and at the major league level after a September call-up.\n Kelly doubled off Antonio Bastardo of the Pittsburgh Pirates in his first major league at-bat on September 5, 2016. He later came in to score on another double, by Randal Grichuk. He had come in as a defensive replacement for catcher Yadier Molina in the 7th inning. He hit .154 in 10 games that season, then in 2017, he hit .174 in 34 games as a back-up to Molina. Both years, he spent the bulk of his time in the minors. In 2016, he split his time between the AA Springfield Cardinals and the AAA Memphis Redbirds, hitting .289 in 96 games, with 6 homers and 32 RBIs. In 2017, he played 68 games for Memphis, hitting .283 with 10 homers and 41 at-bats.\n In 2018, he started the season in AAA with Molina still firmly entrenched as the starter and the Cards preferring that Kelly receive regular playing time in the minors than sit on the bench in St. Louis. Veteran back-up Francisco Pena took the second catching slot in the majors. He was hitting .234 after 21 games when on May 6th he was called up when Molina went on the disabled list. He went 2 for 19 in 8 games before having to join Molina on the injured list on May 17th, victim of a hamstring strain. That left the Cards perilously short of experienced catchers at the major league level. Overall he played just 19 games in the majors, hitting just .114 with no homers and 3 RBIs. With Memphis, he played 83 games and hit .269/.378/.395 with 7 homers and 41 RBIs. Following the season, still blocked by Molina for the foreseeable future, he was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks along with two other young players - P Luke Weaver and IF Andy Young - and a Compensation Round B pick in the 2019 amateur draft in return for All-Star 1B Paul Goldschmidt.\n His first at-bat with the Diamondbacks was a memorable one. It came in the team's second game of the season, on March 29, 2019 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He did not start the game, but came in as a pinch-hitter in a 13-inning marathon and delivered the game-winning hit, a double off Yimi Garcia that scored Nick Ahmed, who had walked and stolen second base, for a 5-4 win. He was at it again on April 6th when his 9th-inning hit off Colten Brewer of the Boston Red Sox drove in Nick Ahmed from second for a 5-4 win. It was his third RBI of the night.\n Although he was signed out of high school, Kelly promised his parents he would still pursue a college education. He began taking courses from the Oregon State University in the fall of 2012, with the Cardinals paying for his tuition. He completed a bachelor's degree in economics in the spring of 2018."},

His high selection was not a surprise as he was considered maybe the best pure hitter among high schoolers that year. He was the Florida Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, spent time with the United States junior national team and played in various national All-Star games. In 28 games as a senior, he hit .422 with 8 home runs. 38 runs scored and 27 RBIs. He was a high school teammate and close friend of Vaughn Grissom.\n His father Alan Greene played college baseball at Florida Tech and was a youth coach, counting his son among his pupils. Riley had a commitment to attend the University of Florida before being drafted but signed quickly with Detroit. He made his professional debit in 2019, playing for three different minor league teams: the GCL Tigers, Connecticut Tigers and West Michigan Whitecaps. In a total of 57 games, he hit .272/.347/.403 with 5 homers and 28 RBIs. he then had to sit out the 2020 season as the Coronavirus pandemic wiped out the minor league season.\n Back on the field in 2021, he started the year with the Erie SeaWolves of Double-A Northeast, where he hit .298 in 84 games. He was then promoted to the Toledo Mud Hens of Triple-A East where he played a further 40 games and hit .308, placing him on the cusp of the major leaguers. Altogether, his stats for his first full season in the pros were a slash line of .301/.387/.534 in 124 games, 95 runs, 84 RBIs, 25 doubles, 8 triples and 24 homers. He also was successful on 16 of 17 stolen base attempts.\n Following his excellent minor league season, it was widely anticipated that he would start the 2022 season in the Tigers' line-up, alongside fellow top prospect Spencer Torkelson. He was on the way to do so when on April 2nd he experienced a setback: a fracture in his right foot, putting him on the shelf for several weeks. He played his first game on May 27th for the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Florida State League, then after two games was promoted to the Toledo Mud Hens of the AAA International League. He was hitting .274 in 15 games there when he got the call to Detroit on June 18th. He made his debut that same day, playing centerfield and batting 6th against the Texas Rangers. He had a great game, going 2 for 3 with 2 walks and scoring twice in a 14-7 win. His first career hit was a single off Taylor Hearn in a three-run 1st inning; the last player to reach base four times in his debut had been Cedric Mullins with the 2018 Baltimore Orioles, and the last Tigers player to do so Scott Livingstone in 1991."},

He helped the University of Florida achieve the first title in school history with an outstanding run in the tournament. In particular, he pitched 7 1/3 scoreless innings against Texas Christian University in the semi-finals to send Florida to the best-of-three championship round against Louisiana State University. He had already blanked TCU in Florida's first game of the tournament, striking out a total of 22 batters without allowing a run between the two starts. He was available to pitch the decisive third game of the finals, but his presence was not needed as Florida won the first two contests to clinch the title. \n Just before the College World Series, he was selected by the Detroit Tigers with the 18th pick in the 2017 amateur draft. In his junior year at Florida in 2017, he had started the year slowly after undergoing knee surgery in the off-season, but had finished strong, finishing at 7-2, 2.60. While he signed with the Tigers before the deadline, he did not play in the minor leagues in 2017, as the Tigers did not want to over-exert him after what had been a long and tiring season. In spite of his lack of pro experience, he was a non roster invitee to the Tigers' spring training in 2018, although it was to have him evaluated by the team's top brass, not because he stood any chance of making the team at the start of the season. He split his first season between the Class A Lakeland Flying Tigers and the AA Erie SeaWolves, making 12 starts at each stop. In 24 games, he went 5-10, 4.02, logging 121 innings during which he allowed just 103 hits and 35 walks, while striking out 110 opponents. In 2019, he was 6-7, 3.90 in 22 starts for Erie with 134 strikeouts in 115 1/3 innings.\n The plan for 2020 was to have him start the year in AAA, and likely bring him up to make his major league debut at the end of the season, provided everything went well. However, the season was upended by the Coronavirus pandemic, there was no minor league season, and Faedo contracted the disease himself before training camp reopened in July. He eventually made it to the Tigers' alternate training site in Toledo, OH, but was shut down in September with a right forearm strain, preventing any possibility of a late call-up to the Motor City. He was then sent to the Tigers instruction camp in Lakeland, FL in October to take part in workouts but the soreness reappeared, and by early December, he was diagnosed with a torn UCL, necessitating Tommy John surgery. He would miss all of 2021 as a result.\n After this setback, Faedo made his major league debut on May 4, 2022, starting the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched well, with 2 runs allowed in 5 innings, but ended up with a no-decision in a 7-2 loss.\n He is a second cousin of former major league infielder Lenny Faedo."},

He is a two-time MVP, four-time batting champion and been named to eleven All-Star teams.  In 2012, he became the first man since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 to win the Triple Crown, leading the American League in batting average (.330), home runs (44) and RBI (139).  \n Miguel joined the Marlins as an amateur free agent in 1999, beginning his career as a shortstop. Part of a blossoming minor league corps that included pitchers Josh Beckett and Dontrelle Willis, Miggy exploded at the age of 20 in 2003, shredding the Double A Southern League to the tune of a .365/.429/.609 line with 10 home runs in 69 games with the Carolina Mudcats. This brought him up to the big leagues, debuting on June 20th with a 1-for-5 day against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The one hit was a big one, as Miguel clobbered a walk-off, two-run homer against Al Levine to make Florida 3-1 winners. He played 87 games that first season, hitting .268/.325/.468 with 36 extra-base hits as the Marlins secured the National League wild card spot. He drove in 3 runs during the team's NLDS victory over the San Francisco Giants, then scored 10 runs while slugging 3 home runs during the infamous 2003 NLCS, opening up the scoring with a three-run shot in the 1st inning off Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs in Game 7 as the Fish marched to their second World Series. In the Fall Classic, though he hit but .167, he again hit a key home run in the 1st inning, taking the great Roger Clemens of the New York Yankees deep for a two-run shot in Game 4, a game from which Florida ultimately escaped victorious, 4-3, en route to a six-game Series win.\n Miguel became one of the Marlins' top stars the following season, belting 33 home runs, driving in 112 and scoring 101 times to the tune of a .294/.366/.512 slash line. Over the next four seasons, 2004 to 2007, he represented the Fish at the All-Star Game each year. In 2005 and 2006, he muscled his way to fifth-place finishes in the MVP vote, earning Silver Slugger honors for the first and second times (once as an outfielder and once as a third baseman). 2005 was his first .300 season, when we batted .323/.385/.561, belting another 33 home runs with 78 total extra-base hits, 116 RBI and 106 runs scored. With the back-to-back 30 homer seasons, he became the youngest player, at 22 years, 143 days, to do so, besting the great Albert Pujols by 80 days of youth. He followed that up the next year with an incredible .339/.430/.568 line, finishing second in the batting race and contributing another 78 extra-base hits (50 doubles and 26 home runs) with a career-best 112 runs scored. \n Splitting his time defensively between outfield and third base in Marlins country, he enjoyed what ultimately proved to be his last great NL season in 2007, once again pulverizing pitching to the tune of a .320/.401/.565 line, 34 home runs and 119 RBI. That season, Miggy became the third youngest man to reach 500 RBI in big league history, at just 24 years and 139 days. The only men to do it younger were a pair of Hall of Famers: Mel Ott (23 years, 74 days) and Ted Williams (24 years, 4 days). He did the deal on September 4th, driving home Hanley Ramirez with a single against the Washington Nationals' Shawn Hill in a 4-3 loss at RFK Stadium.  Miguel finished the season high on the Marlins all-time leaderboards, coming in hot at number one in batting average (.313), second in home runs (138) and third in RBI (523). Unfortunately for him, he had earned a significant salary increase in arbitration, beating the Marlins and earning a $7.3 million deal through the process prior to the season.  With the franchise nowhere near contention (as of 2020, they had not returned to the postseason since the 2003 Series triumph) and always ready to deal someone the second they began to make real dollars, Cabrera's days in Miami were numbered.\n So, of course, it was no surprise in December 2007 when the Fish killed two birds with one stone, dealing stars with rising cash flow coming, Cabrera and pitcher Dontrelle Willis, to the Detroit Tigers for a bushel of young players making peanuts, including Cameron Maybin, Andrew Miller, Dallas Trahern, Mike Rabelo, Eulogio De La Cruz and Burke Badenhop. Originally slated to play third base with Detroit, he was quickly moved to first base when Carlos Guillen had difficulties adjusting defensively to first. Cabrera, never a defensive standout, had now found a home as the Tigers' first sacker. He led the American League in home runs that first season, belting the fewest (37) for an AL leader since Fred McGriff of the Toronto Blue Jays mustered 36 in 1989. The American League Player of the Month in July, Miggy's first season in the Motor City ended solidly with a .293/.349/.537 line with 127 RBI. In 2009, Cabrera was again one of the Tigers' offensive leaders, once again hitting over 30 home runs and driving in over 100 runs with a .324/.396/.547 line, 34 homers and 103 RBI, as the team led the AL Central race for most of the season. However, his good year was marred by an unfortunate incident in the season's last days. As the Tigers were trying to hold off the resurgent Minnesota Twins, Cabrera was arrested for physically threatening his wife while under the influence of alcohol in the small hours of the morning on October 3rd; GM Dave Dombrowski had to bail him out of jail. While he was eventually not charged, the event created a terrible distraction for his teammates. In the one-game playoff against the Twins on October 5th, he gave his team an early lead with a home run, but was thrown out at home in the 12th inning as the Tigers lost, 6-5.\n Prior to the 2010 season, Cabrera apologized to teammates and fans alike for his behavior the previous year and stated that he was getting help for his drinking problem, spending 90 days in an outpatient rehabilitation program. He seemed to have put the issue behind him, as he had another great season with the bat, making the All-Star team for the first time since his move to the American League, while hitting .328/.420/.622 with 38 homers and 126 RBI. He led the league in RBI, on-base percentage (.420) and intentional walks (32), finishing runner-up to Josh Hamilton in the MVP vote.  On May 28th, he had the first three-home run game of his career, against the Oakland Athletics; he drove in 4 runs, but the Tigers still lost, 5-4. From June 19th to July 16th, he enjoyed a 20-game hitting streak, batting .397 (29-for-73) with 12 extra-base hits and 19 RBI. Unfortunately, Cabrera suffered a relapse of his drinking problems as 2011 spring training was getting under way. On the evening of February 16th, he was arrested in Fort Pierce, FL as he stood intoxicated and disoriented beside his car. He later explained that he had been driving to the Tigers camp in Lakeland in an older vehicle he intended to ship to relatives in Venezuela, when the car overheated and broke down. Police found him drinking whiskey from a bottle by the side of the car. He was detained and charged with both driving under the influence and refusing to cooperate with police. Other details from that night which emerged later cast Cabrera in an even worse light: before the arrest, he had threatened the manager and a customer at a steakhouse in Fort Pierce, stating he had a gun and knew who they were. The manager had called police and stated that Cabrera was apparently intoxicated when he drove away after the altercation. Police had also received calls from other motorists stating that he was driving aggressively and had forced a number of vehicles off the road on the night of his arrest. After this second brush with the law, Tigers GM Dombrowski stated that Cabrera would need to undergo more vigorous treatment for alcohol abuse before returning to the team. Cabrera missed the beginning of spring training while waiting to be evaluated by a doctor appointed by the Commissioner's office and the Players Association. He returned on February 25th and apologized for his behavior while confirming he would undergo a treatment program. MLB issued a statement that warned he could face more serious consequences if he were to be involved in another alcohol-related incident.\n On the field, Cabrera reached 300 career doubles on April 11, 2011. He became the second MLB player to reach the mark before his 28th birthday - Joe Medwick had been the only other.  He had another great season in 2011, winning the ­American League batting title with a .344 average and also being tops in the league with a .448 OBP and 48 doubles. He hit 30 homers, scored 111 runs and drove in 105, slugged at a .586 clip and, for the first time, drew more than 100 walks with 108. He was named to the All-Star team for the 6th time of his career. The Tigers won the AL Central title and he went 3 for 15 with a homer as they beat the New York Yankees in five games in the ALDS. In the ALCS against the Texas Rangers, he was red hot, hitting .400 with 4 doubles, 3 homers and 7 RBI, but the Tigers bowed out in 6 games. After the season, he settled the DUI charge by pleading no contest in exchange for prosecution dropping the charge of resisting arrest; he was given a year's probation and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service and pay a $500 fine. He had originally decided to plead not guilty, and a trial date had been set, but he changed in mind in order not to interfere with the following season's spring training.\n Before the 2012 season, the Tigers signed free agent Prince Fielder, son of former Detroit slugger Cecil, to a huge long-term contract. Given that Fielder had no position other than first base, it was announced Cabrera would move back to third base in order to have the two big bats in the lineup simultaneously. It was clear that the transition back to a harder defensive position was not going to be easy, and during spring training, Miguel took a ground ball to the face during an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies. Pictures showed him to be bruised and bloodied, and x-rays later revealed a small fracture in the orbital bone beneath his right eye. He had to sit out a week, but escaped what could have been a very serious injury, probably because he was wearing sunglasses which absorbed much of the force of the blow. Cabrera's bat did not seem to suffer, as he made the All-Star team once again, then on July 22nd, he hit his 300th career homer with a tape-measure shot to center field off Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox. On August 14th, he became the first player in the majors to reach 100 RBI, hitting the mark for the fifth straight season as a Tiger. Only Hall of Famers Harry Heilmann and Charlie Gehringer had matched that feat in the long history of the Tigers, with Heilmann doing it seven times and Gehringer five. He gave the Tigers a scare on August 23rd when he asked to be removed from the game in the 2nd inning of a contest against the Toronto Blue Jays, complaining of pain in his right ankle. He had been complaining of soreness for a few days, but after the game said that he was feeling better and that the problem was only a temporary one. He was named the American League Player of the Month for August, having hit .357 with 8 homers, 19 runs scored and 24 RBI. \n At that point, talk began about his potentially winning a Triple Crown for the first time since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. On September 25th, he was leading the AL in both batting average and RBI, and was tied with Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers for the home run lead. He had a late burst in homers to finish with 44 as well as 139 RBI and a .330 average (part of a .330/.393/.606 slash line) to indeed become the first Triple Crown winner since Yaz. Cabrera is also the only player to have won all three Triple Crown categories in separate seasons prior to actually winning the Triple Crown: he won a batting title in 2011, a home run title in 2008 and an RBI title in 2010. Cabrera became the first Triple Crown winner born outside of the United States since Tip O'Neill, a Canadian, in 1887.  He went 5 for 20 with a pair of doubles as the Tigers eliminated the Oakland A's in 5 games in the ALDS, then was 4 for 11 as the Tigers won the first three games of the ALCS against the New York Yankees. In Game 3, he set a record by getting a hit in his 16th straight game in an League Championship Series, dating back to his days with the Florida Marlins; in that game, he also reached base for his 19th straight postseason game as a member of the Tigers, pushing him past Hank Greenberg for the longest such streak in team history. He hit a two-run homer off CC Sabathia in Game 4, extending both streaks and helping propel the Tigers into the 2012 World Series as a result of a four-game sweep of the Yankees. Things did not go as well in the Series against the San Francisco Giants as his bat was quiet until Game 4, when he hit a 3rd-inning two-run homer off Matt Cain, to give the Tigers the lead for the first time of the Series. The Giants battled back, and Cabrera ended the Series by striking out against Sergio Romo in the bottom of the 10th as San Francisco completed a four-game sweep with a 4-3 win.  After the season, he was voted the American League MVP, outpointing rookie Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 362 to 281. There was some uncertainty about the vote in spite of Cabrera's historic Triple Crown, because the multi-dimensional Trout had finished ahead of Cabrera on a number of sabermetrical measures, such as Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), showing that he may have been a better all-around player than Miguel. Cabrera dedicated his win to the people of his home country, Venezuela, as he was the first player from there to win the prestigious award. He also was named winner of the Hank Aaron Award as the American League's best hitter.\n On May 19, 2013, Cabrera had the second three-homer game of his career, going 4 for 4 with 5 RBI; in his other plate appearance, the Texas Rangers elected to give him an intentional walk with two men already on base, only for Prince Fielder to follow with a bases-clearing double. Even with all of that, and as was the case in his first three-homer game in 2010, the Tigers still lost, 11-8. At that point, he was leading the American League batting race with a .387 average and 47 RBI, and his 11 homers were only one off the league leaders. Continuing his hot hitting, he got some help from [[2013 Indians|Cleveland Indians] center fielder Michael Bourn in hitting his 13th homer of the season on May 22nd, hitting a fly ball to the warning track that Bourn was all set to catch until it bounced off his glove and into the stands; he had three more RBI in an 11-7 win and was hitting .466 over his last 8 games, with 5 homers and 10 RBI over the last three. He made it four straight games with a homer with a blast off Scott Diamond of the Minnesota Twins on May 23rd; he also added an RBI single and scored his 1,000th career run as the Tigers won, 7-6. Although given a run for his money by the Baltimore Orioles' Chris Davis, he won the AL Player of the Month Award for May, as he finished the month with a .379 average, 9 doubles, 12 doubles, 33 RBI and 23 runs scored. When he hit his 29th home run against the Chicago White Sox on July 9th, he set a new team record for most home runs before the All-Star Game, besting a mark previously held by Cecil Fielder. He reached 100 RBI for the 10th straight season, the 6th player in MLB history to do so, following Al Simmons, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Alex Rodriguez and Albert Pujols. He was again AL Player of the Month in August, even though he missed some games with a sore back; he hit .356 with 11 homers and 31 RBI during the month. He finished the year with a career-high .348 average (part of a .348/.442/.636 line, all league leading totals), winning his third straight AL batting title, and was second to Davis in both homers and RBI. He missed a number of games down the stretch with various ailments, particularly a badly pulled groin muscle, which allowed the O's slugger to pull ahead of him in those two categories and deny him a repeat Triple Crown. With the Tigers returning to the postseason, Cabrera eventually pushed his record streak of consecutive postseason games in which he reached base on either a hit or a walk to 31. The streak ended in Game 3 of the ALCS, when, in his final at-bat, he struck out against Junichi Tazawa of the Boston Red Sox with the tying run on third base and one out in the bottom of the 8th; the Tigers lost, 1-0, and the Tigers were eliminated in 6 games. After the season, he was named winner of the Hank Aaron Award for a second straight year and beat out Chris Davis to win his second straight AL MVP. He underwent surgery to address the groin tear which had slowed him down considerably down the stretch.\n On November 20, 2013, the Tigers sent Prince Fielder to the Texas Rangers in a trade for second baseman Ian Kinsler. One of the objectives of the trade was to allow the Bengals to move Cabrera back to first, in the hope that lessening his defensive responsibilities would also lower his chance of re-injuring his groin. On March 28, 2014, he signed an eight-year contract extension with the Tigers. Coupled with the two years remaining on his contact, the extension was worth $290 million, making it the largest contract in major league history. The distinction had previously been held by Alex Rodriguez since he had signed a ten-year deal worth $252 million in 2001; he had then upped the record by re-negotiating an extension worth $275 million over 10 years in 2006. However, in terms of average annual salary, he was still behind the $30.71 million earned by pitcher Clayton Kershaw. On April 4th, he collected the 2,000th hit of his career, part of a 4-for-5 game against the Baltimore Orioles. He was only the 9th player to reach the 2,000 hit mark before his 31st birthday. He was voted starting first baseman for the American League in the 2014 All-Star Game and, as his team's clean-up hitter, hit a two-run homer off Adam Wainwright in the bottom of the 1st, his first long ball in his 9th appearance in the midsummer classic. He finished the season strong, being named the AL Player of the Month for September, but still his numbers were significantly below those of the previous two years, although still quite excellent. He batted .313/.371/.524, slugging 52 doubles and 25 homers with 109 RBI. The Tigers were swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the ALDS.\n Cabrera got off to another hot start in 2015. In the Tigers' second series of the season he went 11-for-14 in a three-game sweep of the Cleveland Indians. Those were the most hits for him in a three-game series in his career, and back-to-back four-hit games in the last two games were also a first. He also hit two home runs in the third game as the Tigers got off to a perfect 6-0 start. On May 15th, he set another milestone when he hit the 399th home run of his career, tying Andres Galarraga for the most by a player from Venezuela. He passed him then next day, when he connected for number 400 against Tyler Lyons of the St. Louis Cardinals, one day after fellow likely future Hall of Famer Adrian Beltre reached the mark. Miguel was having another great season, hitting .344 with 10 homers and 29 RBI after 37 games. On July 3rd, he drove in his 900th run as a member of the Tigers and went 2-for-2 in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays to increase his batting average to .350, but he had to leave the game in the 4th inning with a strained calf, an injury sustained running the bases. He was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career the next day. He was voted the starting first baseman for the AL at the All-Star Game, his 10th selection, but bowed out because of the injury. His absence was very costly for his team, as when he came back to action, the Tigers had fallen out of the running for the postseason. He went on a tear after going hitless in his first game back, as he collected a hit in his next ten games, including seven straight multiple-hit ones; that matched a career high accomplished with the Marlins back in 2006. On August 25th, he raised his batting average to .371, the only question being whether he would be able to accumulate the 502 plate appearances required to qualify for a fourth batting crown. He did manage to reach the number and finished at .338, ahead of Xander Bogaerts of the Boston Red Sox, who was at .320. All told, he hit .338/.440/.534, leading the AL in average and OBP.\n In 2016, he was named the AL Player of the Month for September as he hit .349 with 10 homers and 27 RBI in 28 games as he tried but failed to push the Tigers into the postseason - they ended up a game and a half shy of the wild card. For the year, he hit .316/.393/.563 and his power numbers bounced back to their usual levels: 31 doubles, 38 homers and 108 RBI. He was particularly strong in the second half, when he hit .346.  As good as he was, advanced metrics indicated that he was one of the hitters most hurt by his home ballpark, as Comerica Park's vast outfield deprived him of an estimated .142 points of OPS that season (only Kendrys Morales of the Royals was more harshly treated). The reason was that balls that would be sure home runs anywhere else could be caught at the wall by an exceptional opposite center fielder in Detroit. In 2017, he was slowed down by lower back tightness the entire season, a problem that first manifested itself when he suited up for Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic. His production was down in all areas, and the Tigers were never really in the race for a postseason slot all season. He finished at .249/.329/.399, all career lows, with 16 homers and 60 RBI in 130 games, numbers all well below his usual production. \n In 2018, he hit a solid .326 in 25 games in April, along with 3 homers and 21 RBI, but then missed almost all of May with a hamstring injury. His first homer of the year, on April 1st, allowed him to pass Jose Canseco for most career homers among players whose last name begins with the letter \"C\". He was unwittingly involved in a controversy while injured in May when former Marlins Vice President David Samson said that he felt sorry that Cabrera was stuck on a rebuilding team in Detroit and that he \"had always wanted to come home to Miami\" (a hilarious declaration for Samson to make since the Marlins were almost always rebuilding and crying poverty). Cabrera had to go on the record to quell the rumor, stating that he wanted to finish his career in Detroit. He returned to action on June 1st but only went 10 for 41 with a pair of doubles in 12 games before suffering a torn biceps tendon in a game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12th. The injury occurred while swinging at a pitch in the 3rd inning. It was a season-ending injury and he ended the year at .299/.395/.448 with 3 homers and 22 RBI in 28 games. He struggled with knee injuries throughout 2019, beginning the transition into full-time designated hitter duties. It was another struggle. He played 136 games but his slash line continued to implode, finishing a tepid .282/.346/.398 with only 12 home runs in 493 at bats.\n In 2020, the Tigers were playing surprisingly well with a .500 record through the end of August (albeit in only 32 games, given the belated start to the season), but Miggy's contribution was pretty meagre, as he was hitting just .241 with 5 homers and 20 RBIs at that point as a full-time DH. Still, there was one highlight on August 30th, when he collected his 2,000th hit as a member of the Tigers with an RBI single off Kenta Maeda of the Minnesota Twins. He was the 8th player in team history to reach that total, the last having been Lou Whitaker in 1992. While there were no fans in attendance at the game, he still came out of the dugout for a curtain call when the scoreboard highlighted his feat a few moments later. He ended the year at .250 in 57 games, with 10 homers and 35 RBIs. Both of those totals led the team. He started 2021 on a good note as he was chasing down both 500 homers and 3,000 hits. On Opening Day, April 1st, he hit the first home run of the major league season by connecting off defending Cy Young Award winner Shane Bieber in a driving snowstorm. The ball just cleared the fence, something that Cabrera couldn't see given the conditions, and he slid into second base to be on the safe side, before being told he could trot around the bases. The weather soon cleared up after that and the game was played to completion. He missed two weeks of action in April with a left biceps strain and struggled badly in his first few weeks, as he was hitting just .127 after 18 games. Still, on May 7th he equaled the great Babe Ruth on the all-time hit list with #2,873, and passed him with another base hit later in the game. The first of the two hits ended an 0-for-27 slump, the longest such skid of his career. On August 22nd, he reached the hallowed 500 home run mark, with a solo blast off Steven Matz of the Toronto Blue Jays. He had hit #499 a couple of weeks earlier and had been stuck on the doorstep of 500 for a while. By then, he was also within just a bit over 40 hits of 3,000.\n On April 20, 2022, a three-hit game against the New York Yankees brought him to 2,999, bringing another flurry of coverage about his career and the importance of the upcoming accomplishment, given there were so few players who had both reached 500 homers and 3,000 hits. One fact that was unearthed was that his 2,999 hits up to that point included just one bunt single (on June 9, 2006 off Chris Young then of the San Diego Padres). Everyone was geared up for him to reach the magic number on April 21nd but the Yankees spoiled the party: after being shut out in his first three at-bats, he came up in the bottom of the 8th with runners on second and third base with two outs and Detroit nursing a small 1-0 lead. With Lucas Luetge on the mound, Yankees manager Aaron Boone elected to issue an intentional walk to Miggy to load the bases, prompting the 21,000+ fans present to boo heartily as they were being deprived of a potential historic moment. The strategy did not work, as the next batter, Austin Meadows, hit a two-run double that basically sealed the win. He was the first batter ever to be issued an intentional walk while sitting one hit shy of 3,000. After a rainout, he got the milestone hit with a 1st-inning single off Antonio Senzatela of the Colorado Rockies on April 23rd. making him the 33rd member of the 3,000 hit club, and just the 7th to have also hit 500 homers. He reached another milestone less than two weeks later, on May 7th, when he hit the 600th double of his career, off Framber Valdez of the Houston Astros. He was the 18th player to reach that mark, had also entered the all-time top 20 for extra-base hits and was within shouting distance of the top-20 for RBIs (he needed two more to tie Al Simmons for that rank. On July 8th, he was named an All-Star for the 12th and likely final time as a special selection by the Commissioner in recognition of his lifetime achievements; Albert Pujols was added to the NL squad under the same provision. He finished the year at .254 in 112 games, with 5 homers and 43 RBIs. While he was basically a full-time DH, his OPS+ was just 83.\n At the end of November 2022, he announced that the 2023 season would be his final one. Before that, he played for Venezuela in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. That made him one of two players, alongside Mexico's Oliver Perez, to appear in all five editions of the tournament. The season itself was a bit of a farewell tour, and he was no longer an everyday starter, with the Tigers giving an opportunity to a number of younger players to share the DH role with Miggy. On April 15th, he still managed to do something unprecedented in his great career, when he got his 16th walk-off hit in a 7-6 win over the San Francisco Giants: the unprecedented part was that it came as a pinch-hitter, which was a first. In fact, he had only made 28 pinch-hitting appearances overall before entering the game, a reflection of the fact that he had always been a regular player until that final season. On the season's final week-end, the Tigers announced that he would continue to be employed by the team after his retirement, as a special assistant to team President Scott Harris. After being feted all week-end - and in fact all year - he played his final game on October 1st, going 0 for 3 and making a brief appearance at first base after starting as the DH against the Cleveland Guardians. He had actually gone 6 for 11 with his 511th and final career homer in the three games before that, so he did not limp to the finish line even if he was only a shell of the dominant hitter he had once been. His final stats for the season were a .257 average, 4 homers and 34 RBIs in 98 games, for an OPS+ of 86.\n His wife's niece Maigleth Torres has starred for the Venezuelan women's national team while his wife's nephew Mike Torres has played in the minors. \n Through 2010, the similarity scores method showed the most similar players through age 27 as legends Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron, with Ken Griffey, Jr. a close third. Pegged as a player to watch from the time he reached the major leagues, he was on a Hall of Fame-bound track from the start of his career, although there were concerns at one time that a failure to keep his drinking problems under control could prevent Cabrera from having a fully productive career. He defeated those demons and took another step forward, making him one of the players that define excellence in the game. He is the all-time leader for home runs, runs scored and RBI among players born in Venezuela. Entering the 2020 season, he was just 23 home runs short of 500 and, at 2,815 hits, would have needed at least one strong season to push himself passed the sacred 3,000 plateau (the Coronavirus pandemic which cut the season to 60 games made that impossible). A look at the similarity scores now puts Chipper Jones as his closest comparison, although not truly similar, with Hall of Famers Vladimir Guerrero, Frank Thomas and Billy Williams among his top 10.\n In addition to his drinking problems, Cabrera was also sued in 2017 by a woman named Belkis Rodriguez with whom he had fathered two children and who was seeking $100,000 in monthly child support payments. He also had three children from his legal marriage and had already provided his former mistress with a mansion in the Miami area and $12,000 in monthly payments following a preliminary court order. In December 2018, another court order upped to amount to $20,000 per month, although Cabrera filed an appeal and a judge agreed to re-consider the amount in light of the State of Florida's laws governing such cases.\n In June 2020, he performed on a hip-hop single by Hispanic rap star Sibilino entitled \"Miggy al bate\" (\"Miggy at the Bat\")."},

He played in the Yankees system from 2016 to 2022, missing the 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic. He was used almost exclusively as a reliever during that period, climbing the ladder steadily to reach AA by the end of 2019, and then spending all of 2021 and 2022 with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the AAA International League, where he made one start each year, out of 38 and 41 appearances, respectively.

In his debut, he was charged with a 4-0 loss, giving up 4 runs in 6 2/3 innings, three of them coming on solo home runs by Mitch Moreland, Robinson Chirinos and Rougned Odor.  On the positive side, he struck out 7 and walked none.  His second start on July 2nd was absolutely disastrous, as he gave up 7 runs without recording an out in a game against the Boston Red Sox; the start included surrendering back-to-back homers to David Ortiz and Hanley Ramirez.  He was sent back to the minors after that performance.  He was 9-2, 1.68 in 18 starts between the AA New Hampshire Fisher Cats and AAA Buffalo Bisons when, on July 30th, Toronto sent Boyd, Daniel Norris and Jairo Labourt to the Detroit Tigers for David Price.\n Matt earned his first career win in his first start for the Tigers, facing the Kansas City Royals on August 5, 2015.  He allowed only a run over 7 innings for a 2-1 victory to out-pitch Johnny Cueto.  He was again matched up against Cueto in his next start on August 10th, but this time he gave up 3 first inning runs and ended up on the wrong end of a 4-0 loss.  In all, he made 11 appearances for the Tigers, including 10 starts, with a record of 1-4, 6.57, for a combined mark of 1-6, 7.53.  He gave up 71 hits in 51 1/3 innings while walking 20 and striking out 43.  Matt started 2016 in the minors, then was called up to make a one-off appearance on April 24th, when he pitched 4 2/3 scoreless innings in relief in a 6-3 loss to the Cleveland Indians.  He was back in Detroit at the end of May, this time as a starter, but was unable to record a win in five outings.  Worse, over his final two starts, he gave up 13 runs on 15 hits in 8 innings and was sent back to the Toledo Mud Hens following a 16-5 loss to the Royals on June 18th.  He finished the year 6-5, 4.23 in 20 games (18 starts), while going 2-5, 2.25 in Toledo.\n He again shuttled between Detroit and Toledo in 2017, going 3-3, 2.82 in 8 starts in AAA, but continuing to struggle periodically in the majors until finding a groove in late August after revamping his mechanics.  On September 17th, Boyd came within one out of a no-hitter in a start against the Chicago White Sox.  Tim Anderson broke up the bid with two outs in the 9th, but Matt retired the next batter to complete a 12-0 one-hit shutout for the first complete game and shutout of his career.  He went 6-11, 5.27 in 26 games in what was largely a disappointing season.  In 2018, he became one of the Tigers' best pitchers, although the team's poor record obscured that to a large extent.  In 31 games, he went 9-13, 4.39, pitching 170 1/3 innings.  He set personal bests in wins, games, innings and strikeouts (159).\n After the 2018 season, Boyd and his wife, Ashley, went on a mission to Uganda to try to help child slavery.  The couple adopted some 36 girls and provided them with basic necessities while setting up a complex, Kingdom Home, to keep children from falling into the traps of forced labor or, worse, sexual slavery and trafficking.  The shelter was originally started by a local woman who rescued the girls from the sex trade, but she was out of funds after the death of her husband, and the project was likely to fail had the Boyds not stepped in.

Additionally, he was the first Tigers left-hander to record 200 strikeouts in a season since Mickey Lolich in 1974.  On the flip side, his 39 home runs allowed paced the AL, with a league worst 1.89 home runs per 9 innings ratio. \n Boyd is a distant relative of two people on opposite ends of the American spectrum: Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller and former First Lady Dolley Madison."},

Still, the Tigers wanted to handle him carefully, so he did not get to play until the team's third game of the season, but he lost no time in showing his ability was real, as he belted the first pitch he saw from Aaron Civale of the Cleveland Indians into the Tigers' bullpen at Comerica Park for a home run. He was only the second player in Tigers history to homer on the first major league pitch he had seen, following George Vico in 1948.

The Twins had already drafted him in the 32nd round in the 2016 amateur draft before geting him in the supplemental first round three years later and inking him to a contract. In college, he was a two-way player for a spell, pitching out of the bullpen when he was not playing the outfield, although by his junior season, he was a full-time position player. He batted over .300 all three years he was in Hattiesburg, MS, topped by a .351 average as a sophomore in 2018. He hit 23 homers as a senior and his 58 homers over three seasons broke the school record. When the Twins selected him in 2019, he became the highest-drafted player in school history.\n He began his pro career in 2019 with the Elizabethton Twins of the Appalachian League, then after 53 games was promoted to the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League. Overall in 65 games he batted .258/.357/.452 with 21 doubles, 8 homers and 34 RBIs for a very good first season. He then had to sit out the 2020 season when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic and re-joined Cedar Rapids to start the 2021 season. By then, the Kernels had been promoted one level to the High-A Central and in 66 games he batted .264/.350/.508 with 14 doubles, 15 homers, 39 runs and 47 RBIs. He missed some time with what was originally diagnosed as a right wrist sprain, but was later found to be a broken hamate bone, and played a couple of games with the FCL Twins on a rehabilitation assignment.

However, the second game went 15 innings, a rarity since the introduction of the tiebreaker rule in 2020 and he was unable to do much, going 0 for 6 to finish the day 1 for 9.

He was the fifth Puerto Rican drafted that year and the first Puerto Rican catcher. He was the second backstop taken by Boston, following Tim Federowicz in round 7. Scouted by Edgar Perez, Vazquez made his pro debut with the GCL Red Sox and hit only .190/.266/.207 while splitting time with Chia-Chu Chen and another catcher. In 2009, Christian played for the GCL Red Sox (.278/.366/.417 in 10 G) and Lowell Spinners (only .123/.250/.246 in 21 G).\n With the Greenville Drive in 2010, Vazquez threw out 40.8% of attempted base-stealers and hit .263/.328/.337 in the regular season. At age 20, he returned to Greenville in 2011 and made big strides, producing at a .283/.358/.505 clip with 27 doubles, 18 home runs, 71 runs and 84 RBI. He tied for 10th in the South Atlantic League in home runs, tied Christian Villanueva for 7th in RBI and led his team in both of those departments. He was also 6th in slugging. He did not win SAL All-Star honors as Evan Gattis was picked behind the plate. \n Picked for the Puerto Rican national team, he was 5 for 17 with two walks in the 2011 Baseball World Cup. He played error-free defense and threw out 2 of 4 attempted base-stealers. In the 2011 Pan American Games, he was 5 for 12 with a double and 3 runs as one of Puerto Rico's top offensive performers.\n In 2012, Vazquez hit .266 in 81 games for the Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League, then played 20 games in AA with the Portland Sea Dogs. Combined, he hit .254/.344/.369 with 21 doubles and 7 homers. In 2013, he again benefited from a late-season promotion, this time starting at Portland and ending up in AAA with the Pawtucket Red Sox for one game. In the Eastern League, he hit a solid .289 in 96 games, with 19 doubles and 5 homers. He was named a league All-Star, like he had been in the Carolina League the previous season. \n Now considered one of the Red Sox's top prospects, and having overtaken Ryan Lavarnway as the presumptive \"catcher of the future\", he spent the first half of the 2014 season in Pawtucket, where he hit .279 in 66 games. On July 9th, with the team in last place, the Red Sox decided to designate veteran catcher A.J. Pierzynski for assignment and to promote Vazquez in his stead. He was in the starting line-up that night against the Chicago White Sox, going 0 for 3 in a 5-4 win; pinch-hitter Daniel Nava batted for him in the bottom of the 9th, doubling in the tying run, before Brock Holt followed with a game-winning single. He played 55 games for Boston, hitting .240/.308/.309, with 1 homer and 20 RBIs. He was the favorite to be the Red Sox's sarting catcher in 2015 heading into spring training, but an injury got in the way. After six Grapefruit League games, he was sidelined by an elbow problem and had to undergo Tommy John surgery, putting him out of action for the entire season.\n Vazquez was back healthy in 2016, and in spite of Blake Swihart having had a fine rookie season in his absence the previous year, he re-claimed his starting job after making his season's debut in mid-April and kept it as Boston played very well over the next few weeks. He was starting every day, except when knuckleballer Steven Wright was on the mound, in which case veteran Ryan Hanigan stood behind the dish. As he showed no ill effects from the surgery, the Sox began to use Swihart in left field in order to give their other promising young catcher some playing time, but Swihart suffered a season-ending injury soon afterwards. However, competition came from an unexpected quarter late in the year as career back-up Sandy Leon suddenly found his bat after being called up to Boston in June and ended up getting a lot of playing time down the stretch as he kept his average above .300 until the end of the season. For his part, Vazquez hit .227 in 57 games with 1 homer and 12 RBIs, but was not used in the postseason as Leon made all three starts in Boston's loss to the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS.\n In 2017, Vazquez was back sharing the catching job with Leon, with Swihart seemingly out of the picture. He was hitting better, with an average in the .280s at the end of June. On June 27th, he ended a home run drought that had lasted over a year when he connected off Hector Santiago of the Minnesota Twins with a runner on in the 2nd inning of a 9-2 win. His second homer of the year was truly spectacular, coming on August 1st against the Cleveland Indians. In a see-saw game, the Indians had just taken a 10-9 lead in the top of the 9th, and Indians closer Cody Allen seemed on his way to recording a save when Mitch Moreland managed to make it to first base on a dropped third strike with two outs. With two men on, Christian drove one of Allen's pitches over the fence in left-center for a walk-off three-run homer that put Boston a half-game ahead of the New York Yankees in the AL East standings. He finished the year at .290 in 99 games, with 5 homers and 32 RBIs as Boston repeated as AL East champs, barely outdistancing the Yankees. He went 2 for 6 in the postseason, splitting duties with Leon, but Boston was eliminated in four games by the Houston Astros in the Division Series.\n He was back in his familiar role in 2018, sharing catching duties with Leon as the Red Sox managed to remain ahead of the Yankees in a close race during the first half of the season. His hitting was not as good as in previous seasons, however, as his batting average was just .213 in 60 games, with 3 homers and 14 RBIs. Leon was hitting slightly better, but in any case the Red Sox had plenty of firepower in their line-up and could afford to let its two catchers concentrate on the defensive side of the ledger. On July 8th, however, he was placed on the disabled list after breaking his right pinkie finger. He had to undergo surgery and was facing extensive time on the sidelines. He only returned on September 1st and while he appeared in almost every game after that, he only started about half of them. He finished at .207 with 3 homers and 16 RBIs but caught the majority of postseason games as the Red Sox won their fourth World Series title since breaking the \"Curse of the Bambino\". He went a combined 8 for 37 (.216) in 12 games during the run.\n In 2019, he played 138 games, passing the 100-games mark for the first time of his career, and batted .276 with 23 homers and 72 RBIs in what was easily the best offensive season of his career. His OPS+ was 103, the first time he had been over 100. The red Sox missed the postseason, however. He followed that with another very good season in 2020, although he was limited to just 43 games (out of a team total of 60) by the COVID-19 pandemic. In those games, he hit .283 with 7 homers and 23 RBIs and his OPS+ hit a career peak at 111 - but once again the Red Sox missed the postseason. In 2021, they did make it to October, even though his production was significantly down. He hit .258 in 138 games, with 6 homers and 49 RBIs, and his OPS+ fell to 77. He did not start the Wild Card Game, in which the Sox defeated the New York Yankees - Kevin Plawecki got the call - but had a great Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays. He went 6 for 16 (.375) and his two-run home run against Luis Patino in the 13th inning of Game 3 on October 10th was a game-winning walk-off shot over the Green Monster. he then went 3 for 15 as the Red Sox were defeated by the Houston Astros in the ALCS.\n 2022 turned out to be his final season in Boston as on August 1st, he was traded to the Houston Astros for two minor leaguers, Wilyer Abreu and Enmanuel Valdez. He had been hitting .282 in 84 games as the starter for Boston, with 8 homers and 42 RBIs, but he joined Houston to serve as a back-up for the defense-first Martin Maldonado. His departure left the Red Sox very thin behind the plate, to the point that many observers thought the trade was simply a loan and that Boston would look to re-acquire him after the season. In any case, he played another 35 games for Houston, hitting .250, to finish at .274 in 199 games for the year, with 9 homers, 52 RBIs and an OPS+ of 99. In the postseason, Maldonado got most of the starting assignments, although he made at least one start in every round. One of these was truly memorable: on November 2nd, he was the catcher for Game 4 of the 2022 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and was behind the dish as Cristian Javier and three relievers combined for what was just the second no-hitter in the history of the Fall Classic, a 5-0 win. He also caught Game 6 in which the Astros clinched their second Championship, and also his second.\n He became a free agent after the 2022 season and on December 12th signed a three-year deal with the Minnesota Twins worth $30 million. He was expected to split time with Ryan Jeffers, leaving Gary Sanchez to be a full-time DH."},

Taylor, to distinguish him from contemporary outfielder Michael Taylor.\n Michael was drafted out of high school by the Nationals in the 6th round of the 2009 amateur draft. He made his debut the following year, playing 38 games for the GCL Nationals and 5 for the Hagerstown Suns, but struggled with a combined batting line of .199/.276/.298. However, he managed to improve sufficiently in 2011 to convince the Nationals to hang on to him, as he hit .253/.310/.432 in 126 games for Hagerstown. He banged 26 doubles, 7 triples and 13 homers while stealing 23 bases, showing a nice power/speed combination in spite of the low batting average. He then spent the next two seasons with the Potomac Nationals of the Carolina League, hitting .242 in 2012 and .263 in 2013. After hitting only 3 homers in 2012, but with 26 doubles 19 stolen bases, he exploded for 41 doubles and 10 homers in 133 games in 2013, driving in 87 runs and stealing 51 bases in 58 attempts. He had entered the campaign as the Nationals' 5th-best prospect according to MLB.com and was a Carolina League Post-Season All-Star and a MiLB.com Organization All-Star that year. \n Taylor continued to improve after starting the 2014 season in AA with the Harrisburg Senators. In 98 games, he hit .313 with 17 doubles and 22 homers, driving in 61 runs and stealing 34 bases and was a 2014 Futures Game selection. he was promoted to the AAA Syracuse Chiefs at the start of August, but got another promotion, this time to the nation's capital, after only 4 games, during which he went 5 for 13 (.385).\n Michael started in right field for the Nationals in his debut on August 12th, facing the New York Mets. In his first big league plate appearance, he singled against Rafael Montero in the 2nd, then in the 6th, he hit a two-run homer off reliever Carlos Torres, the Nats' third of the inning in what would be a 7-1 win. He finished the day 2 for 4. It turned out to be his only long ball of the year, as he finished the season hitting .205 with 5 RBIs in 17 games. He made the Nationals' opening day roster as a back-up outfielder in 2015 and exceeded his first year's numbers by the end of April. On May 13th, he hit the first grand slam of his career, after entering the game when Bryce Harper was ejected in the 7th inning; he connected off Arizona Diamondbacks closer Addison Reed in the 9th to give the Nats a 9-6 win. On August 20th, he hit the longest home run in the majors that season, as measured by distance traveled, as he crushed a pitch from Yohan Flande of the Colorado Rockies 493 feet to the back of the left field bleachers at Coors Field. he finished the season with a .229 average in 138 games with 14 homers and 63 RBIs. he ended up as Washington's most-used centerfielder because Denard Span, the projected starter, missed much of the season with an injury.\n In 2016, Michael won the starting CF job in spring training, following Span's departure via free agency, but he started off slowly, hitting .183 in April and .217 in May. He had finally gotten hot, hitting .378 in his first 13 games in June, when he had an absolutely nightmarish game on June 22nd against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Not only did he strike out five times to wear the proverbial platinum sombrero, but in the bottom of the 9th, with the Nationals trying to preserve a 3-2 lead with Howie Kendrick having just reached base on a pinch-hit single, he let a single by Yasiel Puig roll under his glove all the way to the wall. The Cuban circled the bases for a walk-off Little League homer on the three-base error, giving the Dodgers a 4-3 win. \"You have to catch it first\", commented manager Dusty Baker after the game, explaining that Taylor had wanted to rush a throw to third base to prevent Kendrick from taking an extra base, and instead had thrown the whole thing away. Rookie Trea Turner eventually took over the starting job and Michael played 76 games, hitting .231 with 7 homers and 16 RBIs. In the postseason, he played three games in the Division Series against the Dodgers, going 0 for 2 and striking out in both at-bats.\n Before the 2017 season, the Nationals acquired Adam Eaton in a trade to play centerfield while Turner moved over to his natural position, shortstop, and Taylor was confined to the bench. However, after a great month of April, Eaton suffered a season-ending injury, and Taylor got a chance to play in his absence, having his best season with the bat. On September 8th, he had a very rare hit: an inside-the-park grand slam. In the 3rd inning against the Philadelphia Phillies, his apparently routine fly ball to centerfield eluded Odubel Herrera, sailing over his head and rolling to the fence, allowing all three baserunners and Michael to circle the bases. Washington won the wild game, 11-10. He had the biggest hit of his career in Game 4 of the ALDS against the Chicago Cubs: with Washington hanging on to a slim 1-0 lead in the 8th inning at Wrigley Field, he came up with two outs and the bases loaded against Wade Davis, with a swirling wind blowing in from the outfield, but still managed to lift a pitch into the wire basket in front of the right field stands for a grand slam that gave the Nats their final margin of victory, 5-0 and force a decisive fifth game. The Nats lost Game 5, but Michael finished the series batting .333 with 2 homers and 8 RBIs.\n In 2018, he played a career-high 134 games but fell to .227 with 6 homers and 28 RBIs. His OPS+ of 69 was in line with what he had put up in his first three seasons, making his solid 2017 season the outlier. In 2019, however, he suffered a couple of injuries in spring training, sprains to his left knee and left hip, putting him on the shelf for an extended period. He was ready shortly after opening day, but then missed all of July and August with another injury and ended up playing just 53 games and hitting .250 with 1 homer and 3 RBIs, being largely confined to the role of defensive replacement in the outfield. However, this was the year Washington caught fire in the postseason and went on to win the first World Series in franchise history. He scored a run in the Nats' win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Game, then went 4 for 12 in their upset win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series. He hit a homer in the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals and another one in his only at-bat of the World Series against the Houston Astros. That came in Game 2 on October 23rd, in a 12-3 win, as he connected off Chris Devenski in the 9th inning after having come into the game as a defensive replacement. It had little effect on the game or the series' outcome, but it allowed him to join the select club of players having homered in their lone World Series at-bat, with Jim Mason, Geoff Blum and Bobby Kielty.\n Michael struggled again in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, as he batted just .196 in 38 games and was becoming more and more of an afterthought on the Nationals. It was thus great for him when he signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Royals before the 2021 season, as it gave him an opportunity to be an everyday player as the starting centerfielder. He made the most of the opportunity by winning the Gold Glove that year, although he was still a below average player with the bat, hitting .244 with 12 homers and 54 RBIs, the occasional home run being unable to compensate for an OBP below .300. As a result, his OPS+ was 77. He improved a bit in 2022, bringing that number to 90 as he hit .254 in 124 games, with 9 homers and 43 RBIs. \n On January 23, 2023, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins in return for two minor league pitchers. He was not looked at as a starter in the outfield, but as an insurance policy in the likely case that Byron Buxton would once again be hit by the injury bug, being a much-better all-around player than his back-up the previous season, Gilberto Celestino."},

In the meantime, he had also pitched in AA for the Tulsa Drillers and AAA with the Oklahoma City Dodgers. His record at the time of his call-up was 8-3, 1.47 in 14 starts; he took over in the starting rotation for an injured Clayton Kershaw. In his major league debut on June 29th, however, he gave up 5 runs in 5 innings and was charged with a 7-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n He collected the first save of his career on June 20, 2017, although it did not come in a particularly tense situation. He took over for starter Brandon McCarthy to start the 7th inning with the Dodgers holding a 12-0 lead against the New York Mets, and he proceeded to throw three hitless and scoreless innings to complete the combined shutout. It was his only decision in 17 appearances, including 4 starts, in which he put up an ERA of 3.41 in 34 1/3 innings. In 2018, he again spent most of the year in the minors, making just 9 appearances in the big leagues, 2 of them starts. He went 0-1, 6.11. It was more of the same in 2019, with 3 major league appearances resulting in an ERA of 18.00 over 4 innings. He was placed on waivers at the end of July and on July 31st, he was claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays, who had traded away a number of veteran pitchers at the trading deadline and were willing to give some pitchers an opportunity to show their mettle. His first outing for his new team came on August 7th, when he took over for opener Wilmer Font in the 3rd inning of a bullpen game against the Tampa Bay Rays. He pitched 4 scoreless innings and received credit for the 4-3 win, his first major league win since 2016. He picked up another win on August 12th in similar circumstances: Neil Ramirez pitched a perfect 1st inning as the opener against the Texas Rangers, and he followed with 5 1/3 innings. He gave up 3 solo homers in that span, but that was very little on a night when the Blue Jays scored 19 times to emerge as 19-4 winners. Overall, he was 4-0, but with an ERA of 8.31 in 10 outings for the Blue Jays.\n Stewart's father, Jeff Stewart, has been a college coach and scout. His brother Luke Stewart also played pro ball."},

He was excellent as a freshman at Cal State Northridge (3-0, Sv, 1.48 ERA, .73 WHIP, 32 K, .136 opponent average in 30 1/3 IP). [1] He had two saves and a 1.13 ERA for the Orleans Firebirds in the Cape Cod League that summer, striking out 12 in 8 innings. Back at Northridge, he slipped to 1-2, 3.35 as a sophomore. He had a 2-1, 2.12 record for the '16 Firebirds. Had he qualified, he would have made the top ten in ERA.\n Joe struggled in 2017 while battling injury (0-1, 12.79 in 5 G). He transferred to Cal State Stanislaus as a senior and was 8-1 with a 1.65 ERA. He tied Alex Vesia and Preston Mott for second in the California Collegiate Athletic Association in wins, led in whiffs (127, 39 more than Mott) and led in ERA (.29 ahead of Vesia). The Tampa Bay Rays picked him in the 7th round of the 2018 amateur draft, one pick before Andrew Wantz. The scout was Alan Hull. [2]\n He made his pro debut with the Hudson Valley Renegades, posting a 2-1, 3.72 record with 51 whiffs in 36 1/3 IP. He was one of the top minor league hurlers of 2019, split between the Bowling Green Hot Rods (2-2, 2.93, 47 K in 27 2/3 IP), Charlotte Stone Crabs (7-2, 1.42, 112 K, 12 BB, 47 H in 82 2/3 IP) and Montgomery Biscuits (3.38 ERA, 24 K in 13 1/3 IP). He struck out 183 in 123 2/3 innings for the year, with a 1.96 ERA and .84 WHIP. He had the third-most strikeouts ever by a Rays minor leaguer; Matt Moore had the top two spots. [3] He was among the minor leagues' leaders in ERA (4th, after Cristian Javier, Seth Corry and Michael Plassmeyer), K/9 (3rd, after Javier and Deivi Garcia), opponent average (.173, 4th, after Javier, Garrett Hill and Corry) and strikeouts (2nd, 2 behind Kris Bubic). [4] Baseball America rated him as the #10 prospect in the Florida State League, between Jordan Balazovic and Shane McClanahan. [5] They also listed him as the #98 prospect in the minors. [6] He won the Rays' Minor League Pitcher of the Year. [7]\n The 2020 season was wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic, though. He returned in 2021 with the Durham Bulls. He took a break from the team to join Team USA for the Americas Olympic Qualifier. He got the start against the Dominican national team, one of the other top contenders. He went 4 2/3 innings, allowing one walk and four hits but three runs (a solo homer by Juan Francisco, a two-run double by Emilio Bonifacio) before Edwin Jackson relieved; he did have a 4-3 lead, doing better than MLB veteran Radhamés Liz. The US won a slugfest and would wind up claiming a spot in the 2020 Olympics (still called the 2020 Olympics, even though they were being held in 2021). He was third in the event with ten strikeouts though, behind Raúl Valdés and Yariel Rodríguez. [8] He was then one of the carry-overs for the team for the Olympics themselves, joined by another pitcher surnamed Ryan, Ryder Ryan. [9]\n On July 22, 2021, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins alongside Durham teammate Drew Strotman in return for All-Star DH Nelson Cruz and P Calvin Faucher. He was in Tokyo preparing for the start of the Olympic Games at the time, and was part of the effort that earned the U.S. a Silver Medal. He got the start against Israel and allowed one run in six (5 H, 0 BB, 5 K), on a solo shot by Danny Valencia. He got the win over Joey Wagman. He faced defending Gold Medalist South Korea in the semifinals and allowed one run in 4 1/3 IP (4 H, 1 BB, 3 K) before Ryder Ryan took over with a 2-1 lead; due to the early exit, he did not get the decision. He tied Masato Morishita for 9th in the Games in strikeouts.[10] He allowed only two runs in 9 innings, fanning 17, in two games for the St. Paul Saints after returning to the US.\n He made his major league debut with the Twins on September 1st, starting against the Chicago Cubs, and gave up 3 runs in 5 innings to be charged with a 3-0 loss. He made 5 starts during the month, going 2-1, 4.05 with a 30/5 K/W ratio in 26 2/3 innings. He was then selected to be the Twins' Opening Day starter in 2022, taking the mound against the Seattle Mariners on April 8th. He lost, 2-1, that day but then won his next three starts to get on a good roll. On September 13th, he had his best start yet against the Kansas City Royals as he did not give up a hit, walked 2 batters and struck out 9 before he was pulled from the game by manager Rocco Baldelli, having made 106 pitches. Another rookie, Jovani Moran replaced him and kept the no-hit bid going until one out in the 9th, when he walked two batters, gave up a double to Bobby Witt Jr., followed by a single and a sacrifice fly for a final score of 6-3 in favor of the Twins. Ryan got credit for his 11th win that day. He finished the year at 13-8, 3.55 in 27 starts, with 151 strikeouts in 147 innings.\n On June 22, 2023, he became the first Twins pitcher in five years to pitch a complete game shutout when he defeated the Boston Red Sox, 6-0, on three hits while striking out nine and walking none. José Berríos had been the last twins pitcher to accomplish the feat, back in 2018 but Ryan was overshadowed by Byron Buxton who hit two homers that day, both measured over 465 feet by Statcast, a feat heretofore undocumented. Ryan was off to a great start, as the win improved his record to 8-4, 2.98 after 15 starts."},

On May 28th, he was called up to San Francisco. The plan was to have him pitch out of the bullpen at first. He made his debut on May 29th against the Colorado Rockies, replacing starting pitcher Jeff Samardzija who had to leave after one inning due to shoulder tightness. He pitched two scoreless innings and retired the first two batters he faced in the 4th before an error led to three unearned runs. He then left in the 5th after being hit in the leg by a comebacker off the bat of Ian Desmond. He also hit an RBI double. He recorded his first win in his first start, against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 3rd. Matched up against former Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta, he held the Phillies to 1 run on 5 hits in 6 innings, the run coming on a solo homer by Arrieta, and he was given credit for the 6-1 victory. Joe Martinez had been the last Giants pitcher to be a winner in his first start, back in 2009."},

He was a key component in the Chicago Cubs first world championship since 1908 and is a two-time National League All-Star.\n Báez moved to Florida from Puerto Rico in 2005.  He hit .711 with 22 homers in 115 at-bats as a high school senior.  The Cubs took him with the 9th pick of the 2011 amateur draft, one slot after another Puerto Rico-born, Florida-raised shortstop in Francisco Lindor; the scout was Tom Clark.  He made his pro debut that summer with the AZL Cubs before moving up to the Boise Hawks.  Overall, he was 5 for 20 with two doubles and two steals.  He fielded terribly, with 6 errors and a .778 fielding percentage.  Javy split 2012 between the Peoria Chiefs (.333/.383/.596, 20 steals in 23 attempts, 12 homers and 41 runs scored in 57 games) and Daytona Cubs (.188/.244/.400 in 23 games).  He finished among Cubs farmhand leaders in home runs (16, tied for 7th) and steals (24, tied for 10th), fielding better at a .950 clip.  Baseball America rated him the top prospect in the Midwest League.  He hit .211 with 16 RBI in 14 games for the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League.  He was leading the AFL in RBI before a thumb injury ended his season.\n On June 10, 2013, he became the second player in Florida State League history to hit four home runs in one game, when he did so for the Daytona Cubs in a 9-6 win over the Fort Myers Miracle.  Ryan Harvey had been the only other player to accomplish the feat in the FSL, back in 2006.  He was promoted to the Tennessee Smokies of the Double A Southern League later that season, and finished with a combined batting line of .282/.341/.578 in 130 games between the two stops, with 34 doubles, 37 homers, 98 runs scored and 111 RBI.  He was ranked the 5th best prospect in all of baseball by Baseball America after the season.  In 2014, the Cubs assigned Javier to Triple A Iowa of the Pacific Coast League, after he continued to turn heads in spring training.  He was named to the World team for the 2014 Futures Game played at Target Field on July 13th and showed his tremendous power, hitting a two-run homer off Lucas Giolito that temporarily put his side ahead, 2-1, in the 6th inning.  He had begun to play second base in addition to shortstop that season, in anticipation of a promotion to Chicago where All-Star Starlin Castro was seemingly entrenched at shortstop.  He hit .260 with 23 homers and 80 RBI in 104 games for Iowa. \n On August 5, 2014, the Cubs decided he was ready and called him up to make his debut that day in a game against the Colorado Rockies, playing second base and hitting second.  He was hitless in his first five at-bats, striking out three times, but ended up the hero when he homered off Boone Logan to lead off the 12th inning, giving the Cubs their margin of victory in a 6-5 win.  After going 0 for 4 in his second game, Báez again grabbed the headlines on August 7th, when he connected for a pair of homers in a 6-2 win over the Rockies; he went 3-for-4 on the day with 4 RBI.  Three weeks after his debut, the Cubs brought up another one of their top prospects, Cuban outfielder Jorge Soler.  He matched two of Báez's feats by also homering in his major league debut, doing so in his very first at-bat, and by notching a multi-homer game in his third contest.  Báez played 52 games for the Cubs in his debut season, hitting only .169 but with 9 homers and 20 RBI in 213 at-bats.  He split his time almost equally between shortstop and second base.\n In 2015, he played 70 games at Iowa, hitting.324 with 13 homers and 61 RBI in 70 games.  He missed time due to injury and played 4 games with the AZL Cubs on a rehabilitation assignment.  He was passed on the Cubs' depth chart at shortstop by another top prospect, Addison Russell, who was called up in May and spent most of the season in Chicago doing well.  Báez had to wait until September 1st to return to the majors.  He played 28 games down the stretch, hitting .289 with a homer and 4 RBI.  The Cubs had made a remarkable turnaround under new manager Joe Maddon, reaching the postseason as the second wild card team, and Javy was on the postseason roster as a backup infielder. He did not see any action in the Wild Card Game, but in the Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, he replaced an injured Russell in Game 3, then in Game 4, on October 13th, hit a three-run homer off John Lackey in the bottom of the 2nd inning.  The Cubs went on to win the games and the series, and he started all four games of the NLCS against the New York Mets.  He only went 1 for 10 as the Cubs were swept by the Mets.  In the 2015-16 offseason, he played for the Santurce Crabbers of the Puerto Rican League.  He spent some time in center field, as the Cubs were looking to increase his versatility in order to give him more playing time.  They were projecting Javy as a Ben Zobrist-type player, able to fill in where needed at various infield and outfield spots.\n On May 8, 2016, he hit a walk-off homer in the 13th inning against Blake Treinen of the Washington Nationals to give the Cubs a 4-3 win and a series sweep.  On September 26th, he hit a grand slam and drove in 6 runs to lead the Cubs to a 12-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, their 100th win of the season. He had a coming out in the postseason, as he was the Cubs best hitter over the first two rounds.  This included a game-winning homer against the San Francisco Giants in Game 1 of the Division Series and being co-winner of the NLCS MVP Award with pitcher Jon Lester, bringing the Cubs to the World Series for the first time since 1945 and their first triumph since 1908.  In 2017 Báez played 145 games split almost equally between second base and shortstop.  He again batted .273, this time with 24 doubles and 23 homers, and scored and drove in 75 runs.  He was blanked in the Division Series against the Washington Nationals, going 0 for 14, then was 2 for 12, with both hits homers, as the Cubs lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. \n In 2018, now playing mainly second base, he had some quirky statistics after 10 weeks, mainly pertaining to how few walks he was drawing: just 7 in his first 233 plate appearances.  Despite that, he had hit 14 homers and was leading the National League with 46 RBI.  No batter had ever hit twice as many homers as he had drawn walks over a full season, but he was in danger of doing so if he kept up his current ratios.  He did draw a few more walks, finishing with 29, but did have more homers, with 34 in 160 games. He also hit 40 doubles and 9 triples, batted .290, led the NL with 111 RBI, scored 101 runs and stole 21 bases.  He was an All-Star for the first time, won a Silver Slugger Award at second base, and finished second behind Christian Yelich in the MVP vote in what was truly an outstanding season.  However, the Cubs made an early exit from the postseason, losing the Wild Card Game to the Colorado Rockies in extra innings; he went 1 for 5 with a double, a walk, an RBI and a stolen base in that game.  Báez was back among the National League's elite in 2019, still not drawing many walks, but bashing the baseball with tremendous authority. On June 23rd, his three-run homer off Seth Lugo of the Mets in the 8th inning turned a 3-2 deficit into a 5-3 win, and was also the 100th long ball of his career.  He returned to the All-Star Game and had hit 29 homers by the end of August when he suffered a hairline fracture of his thumb sliding into second base on September 1st. He missed the next few games, and the prognosis was that he would be out for the remainder of the season, dealing the Cubs' playoff hopes a big blow. He returned to play another 5 games in late September, four as a pinch-runner and one as a pinch-hitter, striking out in his only at-bat, but as soon as the Cubs were eliminated from contention, he was shut down for the remainder of the year. He finished at .281 with 38 doubles, 29 homers, 89 runs and 85 RBIs in 138 games. His OPS+ was 115.\n He was back in full health for the shortened 2020 season, but had trouble finding his hitting stroke as he was barely above the Mendoza line for most of the year, while striking out in a third of his at-bats, although the power was still there when he did make contact. Still, the Cubs were having their best year since their Championship season under new manager David Ross. His baserunning acumen was still in full display: on September 15th, in the 8th inning of a close game with the Indians, he stole second base, but when Sandy Leon's throw sailed into centerfield, he raced all the way home, scoring what turned out to be a crucial run as the Cubs eventually won the game, 6-5, in the 9th. He ended the season at .203 in 59 games, with 8 homers and 24 RBIs. He walked just 7 times while striking out 75 times, and his OPS+ was down all the way to 61 given his dreadful OBP of .238. In the postseason, he went 1 for 8 as the Cubs were swept in two games by the Miami Marlins in the Wild Card Series.\n He entered the 2021 season as one of a number of major league shortstops in the final year of their contract, alongside other starters like Corey Seager, Trevor Story and Carlos Correa, and just after Lindor had set the standard for how much a top player at the position could be paid. But in Javier's case, it wasn't so clear he would receive huge offers, after having turned down a contract extension from the Cubs, because, however spectacular he could be, his badly skewed strikeouts to walk ratio and inconsistent batting average was sure to scare buyers. In any case, he hit much better in the first two months of the season than he had in the shortened 2020 season, and on May 27th, he put on display one of the cheekiest running plays ever seen. With two outs in the 3rd inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates and Willson Contreras on second base, he hit a routine ground ball to third base. It should have ended the inning easily, but 3B Erik Gonzalez's throw was off-target, pulling 1B Will Craig off the bag towards home. Baez stopped running abruptly, and began to retreat towards home. Craig, instead of turning back ad simply touching the base, which would have ended the inning, began to chase Baez towards home. Meanwhile, Contreras was running full tilt and about to cross the plate. Craig threw the ball to C Michael Perez, but his throw was wild and Contreras slid in safely. But his run would not have counted if the Pirates just retired Baez before he reached first base. However, he had turned around again and put on the jets, while no one had thought to cover first base. Perez tried desperately to throw to 2B Adam Frazier, who was belatedly hustling in the direction of the bag, but the throw ended up in right field, and Baez stood up safe at second at the end of a truly astonishing play rarely seen outside of Little League. He batted .248 in 91 games for the Cubs, with 22 homers and 65 RBIs when on July 30th he was traded to the New York Mets as part of a veritable fire sale by the Cubs (Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant and Craig Kimbrel were among those traded for prospects at the same time). Slated to become a free agent at the end of the year, his value was not top shelf anymore, so he was packaged with P Trevor Williams to get a true prospect in return, OF Pete Crow-Armstrong. His OPS+ was 108 at the time and he was leading the National League with 131 strikeouts, against just 15 walks. The trade reunited him with SS Francisco Lindor, with whom he had formed a double play combo for Puerto Rico at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Even though the Mets failed to reach the postseason, baez played extremely weel after the trade, batting .299 in 47 games with 9 homers, 32 runs and 22 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 141. Overall, his numbersfor the season were .265 with 31 homers and 87 RBIs and while he did finish with the most strikeouts in the leagues, 184, his OPS+ of 117 combined with his excellent defensive play made him an elite player.\n There was speculation that the Mets may want to make the keystone combo of Lindor and Baez a permanent feature going forward, but they instead chose to spend their money to address other holes after Javier hit free agency. He found a soft landing spot, however, as on November 30th the media reported that he had come to an agreement with the Detroit Tigers on a six-year deal worth $140 million.\n Báez was bestowed a rare honor after the World Series, as the City of Chicago decided to name a street after him.  Javier \"Javy\" Báez Way is located in the city's 28th Ward, in Humboldt Park, and leads to a little league baseball diamond.  It crosses Luis Munoz Marin Drive, named after the first elected Governor of Puerto Rico, and Baez's name was chosen in order to honor another role model for Chicago's Puerto Rican community."},

He claimed that he had consumed the steroid inadvertently, as he thought he was taking a simple vitamin supplement in his native Dominican Republic. The suspension came on the heels of a breakout season as Minnesota's starting shortstop in 2017, when he hit .256 with 13 homers in 133 games; he had finished the year on a particularly strong note, hitting .293 with 10 home runs in 63 games after the All-Star break, helping the Twins to qualify for the Wild Card Game. He had gone 1 for 4 with a walk and 2 runs scored in the Twins' defeat at the hands of the New York Yankees in that game. He was reinstated on July 2nd, but in his absence the Twins had struggled during the first half of 2018, as they were 35-45 and 9 games behind the first-place Cleveland Indians. He hit .288 with 6 homers and 42 RBIs in his half season, good for an OPS+ of 109.\n On April 5, 2019, he was the first player to hit for the cycle that season, although his feat came in a 10-4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.

He then added a single in the 9th to also notch the first five-hit game of his career. This marked the start of an outstanding first half in which he was the Twins' best offensive players while they were the best team in the American League. He was in turn elected as the starting shortstop in the 2019 All-Star Game. On August 31st, he reached the 20-homer mark for the first time of his career. He was the eighth Twins player with 20 or more homers, a new major league record, and his blast came on a night when the Twins hit six long balls to break the all-time single-season team record with 268, with a month left to play."},

Transferring to Belmont Abbey College, he pitched 21 1/3 shutout innings as a junior in 2012 and was 1-0 with 13 saves. He also hit .292/.387/.411 and stole 18 bases in 21 tries. He fell to 1-5 with four saves and a 4.50 ERA as a senior while batting .287/.391/.483 with 15 steals in 16 tries and 40 runs in 43 games. [1] He was picked by the Seattle Mariners in the tenth round of the 2013 amateur draft. The scout was Devitt Moore. [2] He was the highest pick in school annals to that point; he was 297th overall in the draft, eight ahead of Alex Castellanos (2006 draft). [3] \n The right-hander started his pro career with 20 1/3 shutout innings for the Pulaski Mariners (1-0, 12 Sv, 9 H, 5 BB, 27 K in 20 1/3 IP) and added two more zeroes for the Everett AquaSox before allowing four runs (three earned) in his last four innings for Everett. He still had a 1.03 ERA for his first pro summer. [4] He led the Appalachian League in saves, one ahead of Gonzalo Sanudo. He was named the Appy League All-Star relief pitcher. [5] He went 2-3 with 16 saves and a 2.89 ERA for the Clinton Lumber Kings, with a 1.02 WHIP and 62 whiffs in 56 innings. He led Mariners farmhands in saves (by four) and tied Griffin Murphy for fifth in the Midwest League in that department. In the winter, he was 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA for the Puerto Rican League's Gigantes de Carolina.\n The South Carolina native struck out 10.11 per 9 innings and allowed a .218 average for the 2015 Bakersfield Blaze (3-8, 8 Sv, 2.53). He made the Puerto Rican national team for the 2015 Premier 12. In his debut, he relieved Fernando González with a 6-1 lead in the ninth against Italy and struck out Erick Epifano and Alessandro Vaglio, walked Mario Chiarini and then K'd Alberto Mineo to end it. He pitched a 1-2-3 ninth against Cuba but in the tenth (when two runners started aboard thanks to the Schiller Rule), he allowed a fly and a force to score Yordan Manduley in taking the loss without allowing a hit or walk. He worked 3 1/3 shutout innings in an extra-inning Puerto Rican win over Taiwan, allowing his only hit and second walk of the tourney while whiffing three more. He finished 6th in the event in ERA; Shohei Otani, Scott Diamond, Miguel Lahera, Jared Mortensen and Chia-Hao Sung all worked more innings while also having 0.00 ERAs. [6]\n Emilio started 2016 excellently with the Jackson Generals (4-1, 9 Sv, 1.17 in 18 G; 45 K in 30 2/3 IP) and moved up to the Tacoma Rainiers (1-2, Sv, 3.67, 39 K in 34 1/3 IP). For the year, he allowed a .192 average and struck out an impressive 11.63 per 9 innings. In the fall, he was 0-1 with a save and a 6.55 ERA for the Peoria Javelinas. He then joined Puerto Rico for the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He made his debut with Seattle in May of 2017 and pitched 34 times in the majors, all in relief. He had started the season with Tacoma, and in 23 games in AAA, split over various stints, he went 2-1, 2.56 with 5 saves. In the big leagues, his record was 2-3, 3.22 with 56 strikeouts in 50 1/3 innings. After the season, on November 15th, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics, along with teenage minor league SS Alexander Campos, in return for IF Ryon Healy.\n Emilio pitched 55 times for Oakland in 2018, going 3-2, 4.35 in 62 innings while striking out 63 batters. The A's made it to the Wild Card Game that season, but he did not see any postseason action. On December 21st, he was sent to the Tampa Bay Rays as part of a complex three-team trade that landed the A's IF Jurickson Profar from the Texas Rangers. He had a very good season with Tampa in 2019 after starting the year in AAA, going 4-2, 2.31 with a team-leading 20 saves in 66 appearances. He struck out 96 batters while walking just 13 in 70 innings. The Rays made it to the Wild Card Game and this time he pitched against his former team the Athletics, retiring both batters he faced. In the Division Series against the Houston Astros, he gave up 3 runs in 2 1/3 innings over 3 appearances.\n On February 8, 2020, he was traded to the San Diego Padres in return for OF Manuel Margot and prospect Logan Driscoll. He spent two full seasons in San Diego, although the first one was limited to 60 games by the COVID-19 pandemic. He appeared in 22 games during the regular season, going 0-1, 4.50 with 2 saves, then saw action in the postseason. He was the winner in Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the St. Louis Cardinals on October 1st as he pitched in all three games for a total of three innings, not allowing a run. He then made two more appearances in the Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, once again pitching a scoreless inning each time. In 2021, he made 67 appearances, going 4-3, 4.83. He struck out 69 batters in 63 1/3 innings but the Padres had a disappointing season, missing the postseason after being early favorites to go far.\n On April 7, 2022, just before Opening Day, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins alongside SP Chris Paddack in return for P Taylor Rogers and OF Brent Rooker."},

Facing the Miami Marlins, his former organization, he did not give up a hit through the first 7 innings, before giving up a homer to Starlin Castro leading off the 8th. He ended up a 3-2 winner, giving up just the one hit and run in 8 innings of work.\n Paddack was originally drafted by the Miami Marlins in the 8th round in the 2015 amateur draft, but was traded to the Padres one year later in a deal for closer Fernando Rodney. he then missed then entire 2017 season with an arm injury. He came back strong in 2018, going a combined 7-3, 2.10 in 17 starts between the Class A Lake Elsinore Storm and AA San Antonio Missions. He was considered one of the top pitching prospects in the minor leagues heading into 2019, but most observers thought he would begin the season in the minors given his limited professional experience. However, he pitched so well in spring training that he made the opening day roster and proved to be one of the most consistent starting pitchers on the team. The Padres were careful not to overuse him, giving him frequent additional rest, including optioning him back to Class A for 10 days (where he did not pitch) in order to limit his workload. He ended his rookie season at 9-7, 3.33 in 26 starts, logging 140 2/3 innings.\n Paddack was not as good in his sophomore season, 2020, even though the Padres were a much-improved team. He made 12 starts, going 4-5, 4.73. However, he got to start the Padres' first postseason game in over a decade as the two pitchers ahead of him on the depth chart, Mike Clevinger and Dinelson Lamet, were both injured. He had a tough go of it, though, as in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series, he gave up 6 runs to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2 1/3 innings and was charged with the 7-4 loss. The Cardinals advanced to the Division Series in spite of his performance, but he did not get to pitch at that stage as the Padres were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2021, he went 7-7, 5.07 in 23 games, inclduding 22 starts. He suffered from inconsistency, as he logged just 108 1/3 innings, and in spite of a very good K/W ratio of 99/22.\n Before the start of the 2022 season, the Padres had a surplus of starting pitchers, with the return of Mike Clevinger from Tommy John surgery and the acquisition of Sean Manaea just before the start of the season, the two joining a rotation that already included Yu Darvish, Blake Snell and Joe Musgrove, not to mention others. Chris was the odd man out and was involved in trade rumors from the time spring training opened. He finally was traded just before Opening Day, on April 7th, being sent to the Minnesota Twins alongside reliever Emilio Pagan in return for P Taylor Rogers and OF Brent Rooker. In his first season with the Twins, he went 1-2, 4.03 in 5 games, his season ending early when he had to undergo Tommy John surgery himself, his second time having the procedure. Still, the Twins continued to value his work, as the following January they re-signed him for three years at $12.5 million"},

He began to distinguish himself as a top prospect in 2015, when he went 13-8, 2.43 in 27 games for the Dayton Dragons of the Midwest League. He struck out 135 batters while walking 25 in 152 innings.\n He split the 2016 season between the Daytona Tortugas of the Florida State League and the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Southern League, going a combined 14-6, 3.64 and 141 Ks in 150 2/3 innings.

Through 2015, he has won three ERA titles, two strikeout titles, led the league twice in wins and won two Sawamura Awards. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2016.\n Maeda was a first-round draft pick by the Hiroshima Carp in 2006 NPB draft out of high school. After a year in the minors, he came up to the Carp in 2008. As a rookie, Maeda went 9-2 with a 3.20 ERA. He also hit .182, including a homer off Ryo Kawashima. Had he qualified, he would have tied Yuya Ando for 7th in the Central League.\n In his second season, Maeda posted a 8-14, 3.36 record in 2009. Kenta was second in the league in losses, one behind Ryan Glynn. He was also third in innings (193), 3rd in hits allowed (194), 4th in homers (22), tied for 8th in complete games (3), tied Daisuke Miura for the most runs allowed (82), tied Kazuki Yoshimi for 3rd in strikeouts (147, trailing Colby Lewis and Atsushi Nomi) and tied Miura for second in earned runs allowed (72, trailing Masanori Ishikawa.\n Maeda was far better in 2010, improving to 15-8 (on a 58-84 team) with a 2.21 ERA. He held opponents to a .215 average and 46 walks in 215 2/3 IP, for a WHIP under 1. He fanned 174 batters as well. He led the CL in ERA (.66 ahead of runner-up Wei-Yin Chen), innings, wins (one more than Yasutomo Kubo), complete games, strikeouts (11 more than Kyohei Muranaka), lowest opponent average and WHIP (.15 ahead of runner-up Kubo). He was second in shutouts (2, tied with Kenichi Nakata and Chen, behind Shohei Tateyama). He made his first All-Star team. He won the Sawamura Award (the award that goes to the top pitcher in Nippon Pro Baseball), the first Central Leaguer to do so since Kenshin Kawakami in 2004 and the first Carp hurler to win since Shinji Sasaoka in 1991.\n Maeda fell to 10-12 with a 2.46 ERA in 2011, on a 60-76 club. He had a 1.02 WHIP, 192 strikeouts and 43 walks in 216 innings. While not nearly as dominant as in 2010, he was still among the CL leaders in numerous departments. He led in innings pitched and strikeouts (6 more than Nomi). He was also among the leaders in ERA (7th, between Bryan Bullington and Nomi), losses (4th, behind Kentaro Takasaki, Maximo Nelson and Minoru Iwata), wins (tied for 8th with Nelson and Ishikawa), hits (178, 3rd behind Bullington and Takasaki), complete games (4, tied for 5th with Chen and Tetsuya Utsumi), runs allowed (61, tied for 6th with Bullington), earned runs allowed (59, tied for 5th with Nelson), WHIP (5th) and opponent average (.226, 6th). \n On April 6, 2012, the Hiroshima hurler tossed a no-hitter against the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. He had a perfect game through five innings and walked only two in the whitewash, a 2-0 win. It was the first NPB no-hitter in the regular season since Masahiro Yamamoto threw one in 2006. He started 2012 NPB All-Star Game 2 and was nearly untouchable, allowing only a Kensuke Tanaka hit in three shutout innings. He was named game MVP, the first pitcher to be named NPB All-Star Game MVP since Daisuke Matsuzaka in 2004 and the first Carp hurler to do so since Yutaka Enatsu in 1980. He finished the year with a 14-7, 1.53 record. He led the CL in ERA (.45 ahead of Yusuke Nomura and Utsumi), was second in wins (one shy of Utsumi), ranked third with 5 complete games (one behind Miura and Yoshimi), tied for first with two shutouts, led in innings (206 1/3, 9 2/3 ahead of Randy Messenger) and was third in strikeouts (171, one shy of Nomi and Toshiya Sugiuchi). He won a Gold Glove but did not make the Best Nine (Utsumi got that) or Sawamura Award (Tadashi Settsu of the PL won). He was 6th in voting for the 2012 Central League Most Valuable Player Award, leading all Carp players.\n Maeda was Japan's ace in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, going 2-1 with a 0.60 ERA, striking out 18 in 15 innings. He beat China (5 IP, 1 H, 1 BB, 0 R), with the only hit he allowed being a Lei Li double before Utsumi relieved in a 5-2 Japan win. In his next start, he was even better against the eventual #4 Dutch national team, fanning 9 in five shutout innings with no walks and just a single to Curt Smith in a lineup with six past, current or future MLB players. Japanese relievers, starting with Utsumi, gave up 4 runs in the next two frames of a mercy rule win. He was again good in his last game, allowing only one run in five innings (Mike Aviles singling in Irving Falu) against Puerto Rico in the semifinals, but lost as Mario Santiago tossed a gem in an upset. He finished the Classic first in strikeouts (one over Samuel Deduno) and innings (15, 1/3 over Diegomar Markwell) and tied for second in wins (with Deduno, Dany Betancourt, Nelson Figueroa and Markwell, one behind Pedro Strop). He had the lowest WHIP of any hurler with 8+ IP and only Betancourt and Chien-Ming Wang had better ERAs among those with ten or more innings pitched. He was named to the All-Tournament team, joining Figueroa and Fernando Rodney as the pitchers selected. \n In 2013, he won his third ERA title in four years. He was 15-7 with a 2.10 ERA. In 2013 NPB All-Star Game 1, he started for the CL and allowed a first-inning run on a Nobuhiro Matsuda triple and Yoshio Itoi single then pitched a scoreless second before Hirokazu Sawamura relieved. It wound up being a 1-1 tie. He finished second in the CL in wins (one behind Yasuhiro Ogawa), led in ERA (.59 ahead of Nomi) and was second in strikeouts (158, 25 behind Messenger). He won both a Gold Glove and Best Nine nod, though lost the Sawamura to the PL's Masahiro Tanaka. He finished 6th in voting for the 2013 Central League Most Valuable Player Award. \n Maeda became the first CL pitcher to start All-Star Games three straight seasons since Suguru Egawa (1980-1982) when he started 2014 NPB All-Star Game 2. He retired the first six, then allowed two hits in a scoreless third before Yudai Ono relieved. He fanned three on the day and got the win. He tied Enatsu for second-most wins by a starter in a NPB All-Star Game, one behind Hisashi Yamada. Overall, only Tetsuya Yoneda, Enatsu and Yamada had more wins. He did not win game MVP, which went to teammate Brad Eldred. He fell to 11-9, 2.60 in 2014, his worst finish in five years. He still was third in ERA (after Tomoyuki Sugano and Iwata), tied for fifth in wins (with Shoichi Ino and Shintaro Fujinami) and was third with 161 strikeouts (after Messenger and Fujinami). \n In 2015, he rebounded to 15-8, 2.09. He also hit .194 with his second career home run. In 2015 NPB All-Star Game 2, he relieved Hiroki Kuroda in the third and tossed two shutout innings (allowing hits to Itoi and Kazuo Matsui) before Kenjiro Tanaka relieved. The CL won, 8-3, and he got his 4th All-Star Game win, tying Yoneda for third all-time, one behind Enatsu and three behind Yamada. He was on the CL leaderboard in ERA (4th, between Miles Mikolas and Fujinami), wins (first, one over Fujinami and Kris Johnson), complete games (5, 6th), innings (206 1/3, 2nd, 1 behind Ono) and strikeouts (175, 3rd after Fujinami and Messenger). He won his second Sawamura Award, joining Tanaka as the only two-time winners to that point in the 21st Century, something pitchers like Matsuzaka and Yu Darvish had never done. He also won a Best Nine nod and another Gold Glove.\n Maeda was on the Japanese roster for the 2015 Premier 12, helping Japan to a bronze medal. He had a no-decision in his first start, versus Mexico (5 IP, 5 H, 1 BB , 2 R, 7 K) then beat Puerto Rico with a gem (7 IP, 4 H, 0 BB, 0 R, 7 K). He was 4th in the event in whiffs, between Chris Leroux and Alessandro Maestri. After the tournament, he told the Hiroshima Carp that he wanted to play in the U.S. major leagues in 2016 and asked for his name to be placed on the posting system, which was done on December 8th. However, the Carp indicated that they would only accept the maximum bid of $20 million, a clause that was likely to scare off potential bidders. On December 31st, rumors emerged that Maeda had signed an eight-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, although this was not confirmed until January 7, 2016, when the Dodgers and Maeda held a press conference. The deal only included $25 million in guaranteed money over 8 years, but could be worth up to $106.2 million if Maeda were to earn various bonuses linked to durability. This unusual structure was decided in response to concerns about the future health of Kenta's pitching arm, as the physical exam conducted by the team had revealed potential concerns. \n Maeda had an outstanding major league debut facing the San Diego Padres on April 6, 2016, as he pitched six scoreless innings (5 H, 0 BB, 4 K) and also hit a home run (off Andrew Cashner) before turning the ball over to Yimi Garcia as he was credited with a 7-0 win. He again pitched 6 innings without giving up a run in his second start,m although he was not involved in the decision, and in his third on April 17th, he was finally scored upon when Joe Panik of the San Francisco Giants hit a solo homer off him in the 3rd inning, but it was the only run he gave up in 7 innings as he won again. He was 2-0, 0.47 after those first three starts. The fourth, on April 23d, was just as good as he took a no-hitter into the 6th inning against the Colorado Rockies and again did not allow a run in a 4-1 win, to lower his ERA to a minuscule 0.36. He finished his rookie season with a record of 16-11, 3.48 in 32 starts, with 179 strikeouts in in 175 2/3 innings. He was named to the 2016 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. In the postseason, he lost his only start against the Washington Nationals in the Division Series, giving up 4 runs in 3 innings, but did not have a decision in 2 starts in the NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, allowing 4 runs in 7 2/3 innings.\n Maeda had a higher ERA as a second-year player in 2017, as it went up to 4.22, but his record of 13-6 in 29 games remained excellent. He struck out 140 batters in 134 1/3 innings but was not in the starting rotation in the postseason. Instead, he gave the Dodgers some solid innings out of the bullpen, not allowing a single run in 5 outings totaling 5 innings over the first two rounds of the postseason, and getting credit for a win in each of the two series, as the Dodgers reached the World Series for the first time since 1988. He continued to pitch well against the Houston Astros in the Fall Classic, with just 1 run allowed in 5 2/3 innings, but the Dodgers fell in seven games. In 2018, he split his time between the starting rotation and the bullpen, making 20 starts in 39 appearances and pitching 125 1/3 innings, his lowest total for the Dodgers. His record was a disappointing 8-10, 3.81.He was again shifted to the bullpen in the postseason, and while he saw a lot of action in a tightly-fought NLCS battle with the Milwaukee Brewers, he was not as good as the year before, logging just 2 2/3 innings in 4 outings, during which he gave up a pair of runs. He again pitched in the World Series, this time against the Boston Red Sox and gave up only 1 run in 3 innings, but the Dodgers lost in 5 games.\n In his fourth season with the Dodgers in 2019, Kenta again split his time between the starting rotation and the bullpen, with 26 starts in 37 appearances. He ended up at 10-8, 4.04, with just 114 hits allowed in 153 2/3 innings and 169 strikeouts. He had 3 saves, after recording 1 in 2017 and 2 the year before. The Dodgers won yet another division title that year and had the best record in the National League, but were ambushed by the Nationals in the Division Series. Not that it was Maeda's fault, as he was outstanding during that series, making 4 outings in relief and allowing just 1 hit and no walks in 4 2/3 innings while striking out 7 opponents. On February 4, 2020, he was traded by the Dodgers to the Red Sox as part of the blockbuster deal that brought OF Mookie Betts and P David Price to Los Angeles. The Red Sox were mainly interested in reducing their payroll, however, so they did not keep him around, immediately flipping him to the Minnesota Twins in return for pitching prospect Brusdar Graterol. In Minnesota, he was likely to get a chance to be a full-time starter again for the first time since his rookie season in 2016.\n On August 18, 2020, he took a no-hitter into the 9th inning in a start against the Milwaukee Brewers. He had already thrown 115 pitches, the most by any pitcher in a game that season and the most he had ever thrown in a game, when he allowed a lead-off single to Eric Sogard in the 9th, but he had insisted on staying in the game as long as he had a shot at history. He did set a team record with 8 consecutive strikeouts between the 3rd and 5th innings. However, he ended up with a no-decision as closer Taylor Rogers was unable to get the final three outs without allowing Sogard and two other baserunners to score, sending the game into extra innings. The Twins eventually won the game, 4-3, in 12 innings. For his part, Maeda was clearly the Twins' ace that season, going 6-1, 2.70 in 11 starts in a season cut to 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic. In 66 2/3 innings,, he allowed just 40 hits and 10 walks, leading the American League in WHIP at 0.750, and also struck out 80 batters. He finished second behind unanimous winner Shane Bieber of the Cleveland Indians in the voting for the Cy Young Award. He was also solid in his lone postseason start, holding the Houston Astros scoreless on two hits over five innings in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series on September 29th, leaving with a 1-0 lead, but the Astros scored 4 times against the Twins bullpen to win the game on their way to sweeping the two-game series.\n He was unable to duplicate the success of 2020 in 2021 as the Twins unexpectedly sank to the bottom of the standings in the AL Central after being preseason favorites to repeat as division winners. He actually did not do that badly, going 6-5, 4.66 in 21 starts and 106 1/3 innings. In fact, the Twins top three starters - Maeda, Jose Berrios and Michael Pineda all finished above .500 on a team that went 73-89, but the team started in a deep hole it was never able to climb out of. For Kenta's part, his season ended in August with arm woes, and he then had to undergo Tommy John surgery, putting him out of action for a full year. He returned in 2023 when he made 20 starts in 21 appearances for the Twins, going 6-8, 4.23 and logging 104 1/3 innings. He also made two relief appearances in the postseason, for a total of four innings in relief against the Houston Astros in the Division Series, during which he gave up three runs. Following the season, he became a free agent and on November 26th, it was announced that he had reached an agreement with the Detroit Tigers for two years at $ 24 million.\n With a three-quarters delivery Maeda throws a fastball that sits in the 88-91 mph range (tops out at 94 mph), a change-up, an occasional curveball, and a solid-average slider around 80 mph. He also has excellent command, posting a walks per nine innings rate of 1.90 in his career (through the 2015 season)."},

The pitch was aimed straight at Braves leadoff hitter Ronald Acuna and hit him, some thing to which home plate umpire Andy Fletcher objected. The last starting pitcher to suffer this ignominious fate has also been a member of the Marlins, Jose Urena, who had been tossed on August 15, 2018, also for aiming his first offering at Acuna. In any case, Acuna came around to score what turned out to be the only run of the game, so Lopez was charged with the loss for his one-pitch effort. On July 11th, he made the news again, but for positive reasons this time, as he struck out the first nine batters he faced in a start again against the Braves. Three pitchers had previously opened a game with eight strikeouts: Jim Deshaies, Jacob deGrom and German Marquez. Incredibly, he needed just 35 pitches to accomplish the feat. Ehire Adrianza ended the streak by grounding out to open the 4th.\n López was originally signed by the Seattle Mariners in 2012, and before he reached the majors, on July 20, 2017 was traded to the Marlins along with three other minor leaguers in return for P David Phelps. He reached the majors a little under a year later, on June 30, 2018. he made 10 starts that first season, going 2-4, 4.14 and followed that in 2019 with a 5-8 record and a 5.09 ERA. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season,  he had a very good year, finishing at 6-4, 3.61 in 11 starts as the Marlins surprised everyone by reaching the expanded postseason. He started one game against the Braves in the Division Series, Game 2 on October 7th, and pitched 5 innings, giving up 2 runs and being charged with Miami's 2-0 loss. He struck out 7 and walked none that day, consistent with a season in which he struck out over a batter per inning.\n In 2021, apart from his rogue attempt at meting out vigilante justice, he made 20 starts and finished at 5-5, 3.07, good numbers on a team that finished well below .500. His ERA+ was 136 and he struck out 115 batters against just 26 walks in 102 2/3 innings. He was far from a household name, but insiders had identified him as one of a number of young starting pitchers worth watching on the Marlins. He then started 2022 on a roll, as after his first three starts, he was leading the majors with an ERA of 0.52, having given up just one run in his first 17 1/3 innings. He went 3-0, 0.39 in April to earn Pitcher of the Month honors in the National League, his first time winning the award. While he couldn't keep up that pace, he still had a strong season, finishing at 10-10, 3.75 in 32 starts, with 174 strikeouts in 180 innings pitched.\n The Marlins' biggest problem was a lack of adequate hitting to support their strong pitching, so they decided on January 20, 2023 to pull off a big trade of the king rarely seen in baseball anymore: dealing from an area of strength to improve an are of need, with financial considerations not being the prime driver of the deal as it usually is. So they gave up one of their good young pitchers in Lopez to acquire a good young hitter in reigning American League batting champion Luis Arraez. They threw in a couple of prospects in the deal, minor league IF Jose Salas and OF Byron Chourio. Lopez was joining a team with a strong offense, especially after re-signing Carlos Correa, but that needed help with its starting pitching - in effect, a perfect situation for him."},

His selection was a bit of a surprise, because while he as considered to be a top-ten talent, other names had been mentioned more often as the most likely first selection. While he played shortstop as a senior, he had played third base and outfield in previous years and was considered to have the tools to play centerfield as well. He was described as a very athletic player with excellent batting and fielding skills who was expected to develop power in future years. It was rumored that the Twins had struck a pre-draft deal to sign Lewis to a contract somewhat below slot value, after having backed off from another potential top choice, University of Louisville P/1B Brendan McKay, because of what were characterized as excessive financial demands. On June 17th, the Twins signed Lewis to a contract including a signing bonus of $6,275 million.\n Lewis was assigned to the GCL Twins to begin his career. He began it with a bang as he connected for a home run in his first career plate appearance on June 26th. He had a very solid initial season between the Gulf Coast League and the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League, hitting .279/.381/.407 in 54 games, with 54 runs scored and 27 RBIs. He also stole 18 bases in 21 attempts. In 2018, he split the year between Cedar Rapids and the Fort Myers Miracle of the Florida State League, hitting .292/.352/.451 in 121 games to confirm his prospect status. He belted 29 doubles and 14 homers while driving in 74 runs and scoring 83.\n He was named to the roster of the American League team for the 2019 Futures Game. He once again played for two different teams that season, starting off at Fort Myers and finishing up in AA with the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Southern League. In spite of his taking part in the mid-season showcase, his hitting regressed, as he batted .236/.290/.371, with 12 homers and 49 RBIs. But when he was sent to the Arizona Fall League after the season, he tore the circuit apart, batting .353 and slugging .565. The Twins were unable to find out which of the two Royces was the real one, because the minor leagues were shut down by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. He spent that summer at the team's alternate training site, but in 2021 he was unable to play any games after he tore his ACL in spring training. He kept up his competitive juices by playing a lot of mini golf an by bowling that summer. By spring training in 2022, he had become a bit of a forgotten man, with a number of top draft picks from more recent vintages getting the hype that was once his, even though he was still only 22 when that season started. \n He began the 2022 season in AAA with the St. Paul Saints and batted .310 in his first 24 games, with 3 homers, 21 runs scored and 11 RBIs. In spite of this strong start, he would likely not have been called up were it not for an injury to SS Carlos Correa, which brought him to Minnesota on May 6th. He started that game against the Oakland Athletics at shortstop, batting 7th and went 1 for 4 in a 2-1 win. On May 13th, he hit his first career homer, and it was a grand slam, hit off Bryan Shaw of the Cleveland Guardians in a 12-8 win. He was only the second player in Twins history to have his first career long ball come with the bases loaded, after Danny Valencia. On May 29th, in his first game back after been called up a second time, he crashed into the center field fence making a catch of an Emmanuel Rivera fly ball against the Kansas City Royals and suffered a season-ending injury, tearing his ACL. He finished the season at .300 with 2 homers and 5 RBIs in 12 games.\n One year to the day after his season ending injury, on May 29, 2023, he made his return to the majors and hit a homer and a game-tying single in a 7-5, 10-inning win over the Houston Astros. He had started the season in AA for a couple of games, and had played 8 more in AAA before making his return to the Show, having hit .333 with 4 homers in the 10 minor league games. On August 27-28, he became the first player in Twins history to hit a grand slam in two consecutive games. he had hit one in a 7-6 win over the Texas Rangers the first day, and followed that with another grand slam, this one off Xzavion Curry of the Guardians in a 10-6 win the next day. That gave him three grand slams among his first ten career homers, making him only the 10th player in history to do that. Not done, he hit another one on September 4th, this one in a 20-6 rout of the Guardians; it came off Lucas Giolito, whom Cleveland had just picked up off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels and increased Minnesota's lead on Cleveland to six games with less than a month to go. Having now made it a habit, he added another slam on September 15th, off Jesse Scholtens in the 2nd inning of a 10-2 win over the Chicago White Sox. Unsurprisingly, he was the first player in major league history with five grand slams among his first 16 career homers; the four slams in one season also set a Twins record, and the four in a span of 18 games were a major league record, annihilating the previous mark of 39 games by Don Mattingly in 1987. He finished the season at .309 in 58 games, with 15 homers and 52 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 150. He had a storybook postseason debut in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against the Toronto Blue Jays on October 3rd, as he hit a two-run homer off Kevin Gausman to put the Twins ahead in the 1st inning, and then did it again with a solo shot to lead off the 3rd, providing all of his team's runs in a 3-1 win that broke Minnesota's record streak of 18 straight postseason losses dating back to 2004. He was just the third player in history to homer in his first two postseason at-bats, following Gary Gaetti, who had also done it for the Twins back in 1987, and Evan Longoria in 2008. Even more impressive, those were his first two plate appearances after not playing since September 19th due to a hamstring injury. In spite of the time missed that September, he had stilled copped the American League Rookie of the Month Award after hitting .313 with an OPS of 1.060 and 6 homers and 23 RBIs in half of month of work."},

There was speculation he would drop to the hometown Pittsburgh Pirates at #22. He was the fifth first-round pick ever from the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League and the first since Pittsburgh took Neil Walker in 2004. In his last game, in the finals of the state championship, he was out twice at home. He signed for slot value ($2,817,100).\n Kiriloff was assigned to the Elizabethton Twins of the Appalachian League to begin his pro career. Hitting 6th and playing DH in his first game, he singled off Chad Martin and finished the day 1-for-3. He hit .306/.341/.454 in 55 games, with 9 double and 7 homers, scoring and driving in 33 runs. However, he suffered a setback in spring training in 2017 as he was sidelined by a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing elbow, an injury normally associated with pitchers. He had to undergo Tommy John surgery and missed the entire season. However, he made a full recovery and in the spring of 2018 was ready to start again from where he had left off a year earlier. He was named to the United States team for the 2018 Futures Game. He hit an outstanding .348/.392/.578 in 130 games between the Cedar Rapids Kernels and Fort Myers Miracle.

As a senior, he had a 10-0, 1.57 record and the school again won the state title. He also was an All-5A East selection as a quarterback in football. Going on to college at the University of Arkansas, he was 6-3 with a save and a 5.88 ERA as a freshman. He went 2-4 with a 3.20 ERA for the Wareham Gatemen in the 2007 Cape Cod League, leading the league with 59 innings pitched. His sophomore campaign, he improved to 4-3, 4.58. In summer ball, he was 1-3 with a 2.63 ERA for Wareham and was 4th in the Cape Cod with 54 2/3 innings.\n His junior year at Arkansas, Keuchel went 9-3 with a 3.92 ERA. He tied for third in the Southeastern Conference in wins, behind Louis Coleman and Anthony Ranaudo. \n Selected by the Houston Astros in the seventh round of the 2009 amateur draft, Keuchel was scouted by Jim Stevenson. He made his pro debut that summer with the Tri-City ValleyCats, going 2-3 with a 2.70 ERA in 11 outings. He only walked 9 in 56 2/3 IP. Had he qualified, he would have tied for 9th in the New York-Penn League in ERA. He split 2010 between the Lancaster JetHawks (5-8, 3.36) and Corpus Christi Hooks (2-6, 4.70). He led Astros farmhands in losses, tied Josh Banks for the most complete games (3) and was second in whiffs (133, 4 behind Jordan Lyles). \n He was a Texas League All-Star in 2011, when he went 9-7 with a 3.17 in 20 games before a late-season promotion to the Oklahoma City RedHawks (1-1, 7.50). The other TL All-Star hurlers in '11 were Joe Wieland, Brad Brach, Shelby Miller, Garrett Richards and Matt Shoemaker. He was 4th in the TL in ERA behind Shoemaker, Jorge Reyes and Richards. He led Astros minor leaguers in victories one season after leading in losses. \n He went 5-4 with a 4.26 ERA in 13 starts for Oklahoma City at the beginning of the 2012 campaign before being called up by the Astros in mid-June when Bud Norris went on the disabled list. He was the second 2009 Razorback pitcher to make it to the majors in 2012, following Drew Smyly.\n He made his big league debut on June 17, 2012 starting against the Texas Rangers and giving up just one earned run (but walking four) in 5 innings. He had tossed shutout ball for five innings and was leading Colby Lewis, 1-0, before Nelson Cruz opened the 6th with a hit. Fernando Rodriguez relieved and blew the lead, letting the inherited runner score and taking the defeat. He earned his first major league win on June 23rd when he beat the Cleveland Indians, 8-1 at home, throwing a complete game. He ended his first season at 3-8, 5.27, making 16 starts. The Astros moved to the American League in 2013 and Keuchel moved between the bullpen and starting rotation, making 22 starts in 31 appearances for a record of 6-10, 5.15. He had 123 strikeouts in 153 2/3 innings. He tied Jordan Lyles and Mike Pelfrey for 10th in the 2013 AL in earned runs allowed (88). The Astros' pitching was so poor that season that his innings pitched actually led the staff and he was only one win behind Lyles for the team lead; he and Erik Bedard were the only two pitchers to record over 100 strikeouts. These statistical quirks were partly the result of the Astros having traded their best pitcher, Bud Norris, halfway through the season. \n Dallas took a big step forward at the start of the 2014 season, pitching like a true staff ace. On May 13th, he recorded his first career shutout in defeating the Texas Rangers, 8-0, to improve to 4-2 on the year. Showing that the Astros were still a struggling team, it was their first complete game of the year. He made highlight reels on May 25th with a beautiful - albeit unintentional - defensive play against the Seattle Mariners: in the 1st inning, Robinson Cano hit a comebacker through the mound that Keuchel kicked with his heel - directly into the glove of first baseman Marc Krauss for an easy out ! He had another outstanding start that day, throwing a complete game four-hitter for a 4-1 win, improving to 6-2 on the year. He had an excellent season overall, ending up with a record of 12-9 for a team that was improved but still finished well below .500, with an ERA of 2.93. His 5 complete games were the most in the American League and only less than major league leader Clayton Kershaw. He pitched exactly 200 innings and recorded 146 strikeouts.\n He then started the 2015 season red hot, as he was named the AL Pitcher of the Month in April on the strength of 3-0 record, an 0.73 ERA and 22 strikeouts in a league-leading 37 innings. The Astros won all five of his starts and were in an unfamiliar position, on top of the AL West standings, at the end of the month. He was the first Astros pitcher to win the award since Wandy Rodriguez back in 2009. He had another great game on May 30th when he shut out the Chicago White Sox on four hits, striking out a career-high 11, to improve to 7-1 on the year. He repeated as AL Pitcher of the Month, having gone 4-1, 2.62 with 38 strikeouts in 44 2/3 innings in May. On June 25th, he struck out 12, adding one to the career high set three weeks earlier, in pitching a six-hit shutout over the New York Yankees. He was named to the major league All-Star team for the first time on the strength of a record of 11-4, 2.23 over the first half, during which he led the AL in both wins and ERA. He received the honor of starting the game for the American League at Great American Ball Park, giving up an unearned run in tow innings. In his first start after the game, on July 19th, he once again increased his career-high for strikeouts in a game, this time logging 13 in 7 scoreless innings in a 10-0 win over the Texas Rangers. He was the AL's Pitcher of the Month for the third time in August, when he went 4-1, 1.94 with 41 strikeouts in 41 2/3 innings. On October 2nd, he became a twenty-game winner in defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks, 21-5, in the highest-scoring game in team history. The last pitcher to win 20 games for the Astros had been Roy Oswalt in 2005. His 20 wins were the most in the league, while his ERA of 2.48 was second in the league, just behind David Price's 2.45. He also set a record by going 15-0 at home, the most home wins without a loss in a season. He then started and won the Wild Card Game against the Yankees on October 6th, pitching 6 scoreless innings during which he struck out 7, walked 1 and allowed only 3 singles. he then started and won Game 3 of the Division Series, 4-2 over the Kansas City Royals, and was used in relief in Game 5 in a desperate attempt by manager A.J. Hinch to keep his team alive, but he was touched for three runs in one inning as Kansas City eventually won, 7-2. After the season, he was voted the winner of the 2015 American League Cy Young Award, finishing ahead of David Price.\n On May 2, 2016, he lost a home start to the Minnesota Twins, 6-2, ending a streak of 17 straight victories at home. He could not repeat his success from the previous season, finishing the season at 9-12, 4.55 in 26 starts. He pitched 168 innings and struck out 144. In 2017, however, he had an excellent month of April, going 5-0 in 6 starts with an ERA of 1.21 and was named the AL Pitcher of the Month. He then spent 10 days on the disabled list in May because of a pinched nerve in his neck, but came back to win his next two starts to improve to 9-0 after 11 outings. However, on June 8th, he returned to the DL, his neck problem having flared up again. He was roughed up in his first three starts following his return from the disabled list on July 28th, allowing 14 runs in 12 innings. That included his worst outing of the year on August 8th against the last-place Chicago White Sox during which he allowed 8 runs in 4 innings in an 8-5 loss. he finished the year at 14-5, 2.90 in 23 starts, having pitched 145 2/3 innings. In the postseason, he won a game against the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series and one of two starts against the New York Yankees in the ALCS as the Astros reached the 2017 World Series. he started Game 1 and Game 5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, being charged with a 3-1 loss in the opener, and ending up with a no-decision in the other game as he gave up 4 runs in 3 2/3 innings in what turned out to be a wild game, won by the Astros, 13-12, in 10 innings. The Astros went on to win the Series in 7 games. Back with Houston in 2018, he was fully healthy, logging 204 2/3 innings in 34 starts. He was a true workhorse, leading the American League in starts and batters faced, as well as hits allowed. His record was 12-11, 3.74. He made two starts in the postseason, one against the Cleveland Indians in the Division Series and one against the Red Sox in the ALCS. In both games, he pitched exactly 5 innings, giving up 2 runs on 4 hits and ended up both times with a no-decision.\n Keuchel became a free agent following the 2018 season and expected to cash in his past success with a lucrative multi-year contract. However, teams found his demands too rich for their taste and he was unable to find anyone willing to bite. As the season rolled around, he refused to lower his demands, for example by accepting a one-year deal, and remained on the sidelines, unwilling to compromise. He was not the only one in this situation, as Craig Kimbrel was also still unsigned in spite of his past success. Both pitchers had to wait until after the 2019 amateur draft to find team, and for the removal of potential compensation to be paid in the form of draft picks now being removed. In Keuchel's case, it was reported on June 6th that he was on the verge of signing a one-year deal with the Atlanta Braves for $13 million. The deal did take place and he made his debut for the Braves on June 21, 2019, pitching 5 innings in a start against the Washington Nationals. He made 19 starts for the Braves, going 8-8, 3.75. He made two more starts in the postseason, in Games 1 and 4 of the Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and did not have a decision, while allowing 4 runs in 8 innings of work. He was a free agent again after the season and this time did not have to wait as long to find a team, signing with the Chicago White Sox on December 21st for three years and $55.5 million.\n He quickly showed his leadership with the White Sox in spring training in 2020, when he invited the entire organization - some 150 persons including wives and girlfriends of players, but also clubhouse attendants, secretaries, batboys and so forth - to a dinner at a nearby steakhouse - and he picked up the entire tab, around $25,000. The purpose was to help the group bond, and to make it clear that he had joined the team in order to make it to the postseason, and that he wanted everyone else at the event to be on board and work toward that goal. The Sox also made an accommodation to team rules for him: while the team allows facial hair, it has to be trim and neat, not qualificatives that would describe Keuchel's usual wild mane of facial hair. He did take some scissors to trim his winter growth, but not enough to satisfy team rules, until owner Jerry Reinsdorf intervened and said that, as long as the team was winning, he would be allowed to keep a longer beard than would normally have been allowed. He went 6-2, 1.99 in 11 starts in that pandemic-shortened season. He finished fifth in the voting for the Cy Young Award. He then started Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Oakland Athletics on September 30th, but he was hit hard, allowing 5 runs on 6 hits in 3 1/3 innings to be charged with a 5-3 loss. He was not as good in 2021, as he finished the year at 9-9, 5.28 in 32 games, with 189 hit allowed in 162 innings, and 95 strikeouts. As a result, he was not used as the White Sox were defeated in four games by the Houston Astros in the Division Series. He then continued to struggle early in 2022, going 2-5, 7.88 over his first 8 start, with as many walks as strikeouts - 20. On May 28th, the White Sox had him designated for assignment even though he was still owed $18 million. At leastm their decision to cut bait assured the Sox that they would a potention $20-million option for 2023 would not vest."},

He was in the MLB European Academy that year. He was 8 for 20 with 4 walks, 3 steals, 2 doubles and 8 runs in 2009. His American mother and Polish father were both ballet dancers and enrolled him in a bilingual school in Berlin where he was exposed to baseball starting in elementary school. His love of the game was strengthened during regular visits to the United States for summer holidays, and he kept at the game even when all his friends were playing soccer, and baseball facilities were ramshackle.\n Kepler-Rozycki was signed by scout Howard Norsetter for the Minnesota Twins in July 2009. Baseball America speculated he might have broken Alexander Smit's European signing bonus record of $800,000; it was later confirmed that the bonus was $775,000, just below the record-setting figure. He was the third German to sign with the Twins chain, following Tim Henkenjohann and Rodney Gessmann. Kepler-Rozycki injured his foot July 2009, and missed the European Junior Championship as a result. He attended instructional league in September and enrolled at Fort Myers Senior High School across from the Twins' Florida facilities.\n He became known simply as Max Kepler after moving to the U.S. and had a strong pro debut. On Opening Day, 2010, June 21st, he started in center and hit second for the GCL Twins. He went 3 for 5 with a double, run and 3 RBI. He hit .287 in 37 games that first season. In 2011 he moved up to the Elizabethton Twins of the Appalachian League, where he hit .262 in 50 games. he hit his first professional homer that season, and in 2012, repeating the level, he hit 10 of them, to go along with a .297/.387/.539 batting line, with 40 runs scored and 49 RBIs in 59 games. That performance comforted the Twins that he was a potentially special player, even though he would likely need more development time than the average prospect, given his background. As he later explained, he had never faced a pitcher who threw above 80 mph in Germany, while in the States \"I saw a guy throwing 98 with no control, which is scary.\"\n In 2013, he moved up to the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League, his first taste of full-season ball. He only played 67 games however, and his batting average fell to .237 with 9 homers and 40 RBIs. The Twins still moved him up one level in 2014, to the Fort Myers Miracle of the Florida State League. He took a big step forward that year, hitting .264 in 102 games, with 20 doubles and 5 homers, driving in 59 runs and scoring 53 and recapturing his prospect status.\n Kepler had a breakout season for the Chattanooga Lookouts in 2015, when he hit .322/.416/.531 in 112 games, with 32 doubles, 13 triples and 9 homers, 76 runs scored and 71 RBIs. He was named to the World team for the 2015 Futures Game and was voted the Southern League Player of the Year, as well as earning a berth on its All-Star team. He earned a late-season call-up to Minnesota, with the team fighting for a playoff slot. He made his major league debut on September 27th when he pinch-hit for veteran Torii Hunter in the 9th inning of a 7-1 win over the Detroit Tigers. He struck out against Tom Gorzelanny, then took over Hunter's spot in right field for the final half-inning of the game, a symbolic move given that the Twins were looking at him as Torii's potential successor. He went 1 for 7 in three games in his first cup of coffee in the big leagues.\n Max started 2016 with the AAA Rochester Red Wings, but was back in the majors on April 10th. He stayed with the team until the end of the month, but hit only .167 in limited playing time and was sent back to Rochester. He returned to Minnesota in early June and began to play regularly in right field after Miguel Sano was placed on the disabled list, prompting a shuffle in the outfield. On June 12th, he hit his first career homer, and it was a memorable one, a walk-off three-run blast in the 10th inning off Matt Barnes of the Boston Red Sox that led to a 7-4 win. That home run seemed to unlock his power stroke, and he went on a tear over the next few weeks. On August 1st, he hit three two-run homers and added a single in a 12-6 win over the Cleveland Indians. Two of the long balls came against Danny Salazar, and the third off Cody Anderson; he was the 5th player in team history to have a three-homer game. In spite of the time he spent in the minors, the outburst made him the American League leader for homers (14) and RBIs (44) among rookies. he finished the year with a .235 average, but 20 doubles, 17 homers and 63 RBIs in 113 games. \n Max Kepler, a native of Berlin, Germany, is the first German-born product of MLB's European Elite Camp to appear on an Opening Day roster in Major League history when he made the Minnesota Twins' opening day roster in 2017. He had another productive season, hitting .243 in 147 games as the regular rightfielder, with 32 doubles, 19 homers, 67 runs and 67 RBIs. The Twins surprised most observers by claiming a spot in the Wild Card Game that year, and he went 1 for 3 with a double and a walk in Minnesota's loss to the New York Yankees. However, like the team as a whole, he had a disappointing season in 2018, seeing his batting average slide to .224, as the Twins finished well out of the playoffs. It was not all bad, though, since he hit 30 doubles and 20 homers, and by drawing 71 walks actually had a higher OBP than in his first two seasons in spite of his lower batting average. \n He continued to improve early in 2019, as he was now combining a decent batting average and walk rate with his power and the Twins were one of the best teams in the American League. On June 6th, he had the second three-homer game of his career, hitting all three long balls against Trevor Bauer in a 5-4 win over the Indians. He came up in the 9th with a chance at a four-homer game, but hit a single. On June 18th, he entered a game against the Boston Red Sox as a pinch-hitter in the 6th for Marwin Gonzalez and drew a walk. He stayed in the game in right field and proceeded to record a game-tying single in the 8th, a game-tying home run off Hector Velazquez in the 13th, and a walk-off hit in the 17th inning as Minnesota won the marathon game, 4-3. On July 13th, the next time he faced Bauer, he hit homers in his first two at-bats to give him an incredible 5 consecutive at-bats with a homer against the Indians' pitcher. He broke Bobby Thomson's 68-year-old record of homers by a major leaguer born in Europe (though Thomson did not grow up there) when he took Mike Minor deep on August 16th for his 33rd dinger of 2019. He finished the season at .252 with 36 homers and 90 RBIs, second on the team in homers behind Nelson Cruz as the Twins set a new major league record with 307 long balls. However, they were swept by the New York Yankees in three games in the Division Series; Max contributed by going 0 for 10 in the three games.\n He started the 2020 season with a bang, as he homered twice in the long-delayed opening day game against the Chicago White Sox on July 24th. He homered on the first pitch of the game against Lucas Giolito, and repeated the feat in the 2nd inning as the Twins were 10-5 winners. He was the first player in team history to homer twice on opening day since Jacque Jones in 2002."},

He tied for 2nd in the event with two homers (one behind Triston Casas) and tied for 4th in walks but led in whiffs. [1] The Philadelphia Phillies took him in the 37th round of the 2017 amateur draft but he opted for college - even though he did not speak English at the time.\n In 2018, he hit .275/.398/.556 with 17 HR and 69 RBI in 62 games for Auburn University. He broke Frank Thomas's Auburn freshman record for RBI. Only one freshman in NCAA Division I had more dingers and he was Freshman All-American.

[4]\n Edouard was picked by the Minnesota Twins in the 18th round of the 2019 amateur draft. The scout was Jack Powell. [5] He did not play due to an injury which he sustained at the Pan-Am Games and had Tommy John surgery that fall. [6] After sitting out the 2020 season when the Coronavirus pandemic shut down the minor leagues, he finally made his pro debut in 2021 with the Fort Myers Miracle of the Low-A East. He also played for the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the High-A Central that season, hitting .267/.434/.480, with 28 doubles and 18 homers in 112 games between the two teams. He started the 2022 season with the Wichita Wind Surge of the AA Texas League.\n In Canada's opening game at the 2023 World Baseball Classic on March 12th, he homered on the first pitch thrown by Akeel Morris as the lead-off hitter against the British national team in the bottom of the 1st. Great Britain had scored three times and chased starter Paul Quantrill in the top of the 1st, but Julien's blast keyed a four-run inning that gave the Canucks the lead. He batted .538 for the event, with an OBP of .667, second among all batters in both categories behind only teammate Tyler O'Neill. With the Canadian team, he formed an infield with fellow Quebeckers Otto Lopez at shortstop and Abraham Toro at third base. He started the year with the AAA St. Paul Saints and was hitting .290 with an OBP of .421 after 9 games when he was called up to Minnesota. He made his debut on April 12th, starting at second base and batting 8th against the Chicago White Sox. he went 0 for 2 with a walk in a 3-1 win. The next day, he was the Twins' leadoff hitter at New Yankee Stadium and triggered a nine-run 1st inning by leading off the game with his first career hit, then adding his first career homer when the team batted around. Minnesota went on to an 11-2 won over the New York Yankees. The homer was one of three consecutive blasts, with Michael A. Taylor preceding Julien, and Carlos Correa following him."},

That allowed him to make some limited appearances in minor league baseball in the Minnesota Twins organization, the Twins having drafted him in the third round of the 2016 amateur draft, making him the highest ever draftee from the Academy.\n After completing the two years, he was able to serve out the remaining three years of his commitment as part of the Reserve, with 24 days of active duty per year which could be taken in the off-season. His wife Savannah is also an Air Force officer, serving in the intelligence branch at Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, GA, where they make their home; she has done a tour of duty in Afghanistan.

He played in the AFLAC All-American game. Baseball America ranked him as the #52 prospect entering the 2008 amateur draft. Due to a strong college commitment, he fell to the 27th round before the Chicago Cubs picked him. He did not sign.\n Gray was 5-1 with 5 saves and a 4.30 ERA as a college freshman.

In the big event, the 2010 World University Championship, he fanned 14 in a one-hit, no-walk, 69-pitch, five-inning complete game shutout of Sri Lanka (a mercy rule contest). In the semifinals, he limited Japan to two runs (one earned) in seven innings before Noe Ramirez wrapped up the win. He beat the heralded Yuki Saito in an event held in Tokyo. The USA wound up with the Silver Medal, losing to Cuba in the finale. Gray led Team USA in both wins and Ks (20) in the event. He tied Yadier Pedroso for the most wins in the Championship while leading in whiffs (two ahead of Miguel González). González beat him out for the award as the All-Star starting pitcher.\n His junior year, Gray helped Vanderbilt make it to the 2011 College World Series. Entering the Series, he was 12-3 with a 1.97 ERA, 119 strikeouts and a .191 average allowed in 114 1/3 innings. He had walked 41. The Oakland A's took him with the 18th pick of the 2011 amateur draft; fellow Vanderbilt starter Grayson Garvin went later in the first round.\n Gray was signed by scout Matt Ranson for $1.54 million for Oakland and made his pro debut with the AZL Athletics. He was then promoted to the AA Midland RockHounds, where he went 1-0 with an 0.45 ERA in 5 starts. He spent most of the 2012 season back at Midland, going 6-9, 4.14 in 26 games. He also made one appearance in AAA with the Sacramento RiverCats, giving up 4 runs in as many innings. He started 2013 with Sacramento and was 8-5, 2.61 after 16 starts when he got the call to Oakland on July 10th. He had 107 strikeouts against 34 walks in 102 1/3 innings. In his debut, he pitched two inning in a loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, giving up a hit and striking out three. He made another relief appearance, then returned to the minors for a while and was back in Oakland to stay on August 10th, when he made his first big league start. He was a 5-4 loser to the Toronto Blue Jays that day, but stayed in the rotation until the end of the year, making 10 starts and pitching quite well. He finished the year at 5-3, 2.57, allowing only 51 hits in 64 innings, while striking out 67. The A's tabbed him to start Game 2 of the ALDS against the Detroit Tigers on October 5th and he went toe-to-toe with Justin Verlander, giving up no runs on 4 hits in 8 innings. The game was still scoreless when he was replaced by Grant Balfour to start the 9th, and the Australian closer was credited with the 1-0 win when Stephen Vogt drove in Yoennis Cespedes against Rick Porcello for the winning run in the bottom of the 9th. Given his great performance, he was given the ball for the decisive Game 5 on October 10th, but things did not go as well. Verlander had another superlative performance, giving up no runs in 8 innings, while Sonny coughed up 3 in 5 innings to get tagged with a 3-0 loss.\n Gray was back in the A's starting rotation at the beginning of 2014. On April 28th, he pitched his first career complete game and shutout when he defeated the Texas Rangers and ace Yu Darvish, 4-0, to improve to 4-1 for the month. He was named the American League's Pitcher of the Month, finishing with a 1.76 ERA and 37 strikeouts in 41 innings. He was again the Pitcher of the Month in July as he went a perfect 5-0 with a 1.03 ERA in 5 starts, his performance going a bit under the radar as the A's were busy acquiring starting pitchers during the period, adding Jeff Samardzija, Jason Hammel and Jon Lester to their starting rotation. For all of the pricey acquisitions, it was Gray who saved the A's season by tossing a six-hit shutout against the Texas Rangers on the final day of the regular season, September 28th, the 4-0 win securing the second wild card slot for the A's. They finished only one game ahead of the Seattle Mariners, after posting the best record in the majors over the first half of the season. Gray finished the season at 14-10, 3.08 in 33 starts, pitching 219 innings and recording 183 strikeouts.\n Sonny was outstanding as the A's opening day starter on April 6, 2015. He held the Rangers hitless through 7 innings before Ryan Rua led off the 8th with a single, breaking his bid to match Bob Feller's feat of pitching a no-hitter on opening day. Gray settled for credit for an 8-0 win, in which he gave up only that hit and a walk in 8 innings. Incidentally, the win ended a ten-year streak of losing on opening day for the A's. He was one of the few bright lights as the A's could not get on track in the early going. Thanks to an 8-1 win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 14th, he improved his record to 8-3 and lowered his ERA to 1.60, best in the majors at that point, even though the A's were in last place in the AL West. He ended the first half by pitching a two-hit shutout in a 2-0 win over the Cleveland Indians. He had been named to the All-Star team a few days earlier, but had to bow under the Sunday Starter rule. He finished the first half at 10-3, 2.04. He threw another shutout on July 28th, this one a three-hitter in a 2-0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. the A's had a very tough second half, however, eventually ending up in last place, and as a result he only won four more games after the All-Star break. Still, his record of 14-7, 2.73 was excellent.\n Sonny was slated to be the A's opening day starter on April 4, 2016, but a bout of food poisoning sent him to hospital and Rich Hill had to fill in for him at short notice. He made his season's debut two days later. He struggled with his command in the early weeks, capping it with an outing against the New York Yankees on May 21st in which he made three wild pitches and walked four in 3 1/3 innings. Two days later, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained muscle in his back. Overall, it was a season to forget as he finished at 5-11, 5.69 in 22 starts. However, he bounced back in 2017, even though he was still pitching in front of a struggling team. In 16 starts for the A's, he was 6-5, 3.43, and his name was continually mentioned in trade rumors starting in late June, as he was clearly one of the better starting pitchers available to a contender willing to pay the price at the trading deadline. It took until July 31st for the expected trade to be finalized, and the winners of the lottery were the New York Yankees, who gave up prospects Dustin Fowler, James Kaprielian and Jorge Mateo to bring him on board; a sure sign that Oakland was focusing on the distant future at that point was that two of the prospects - Fowler and Kaprielian - were out for the rest of the season with injuries at the time of the trade. he made 11 starts for New York, going 4-7, 3.72 to finish the year at 10-12, 3.55. he was given a chance to pitch in the postseason as well, making a start each in the Division Series against the Cleveland Indians, and another in the ALCS against the Houston Astros. The first of these ended up in a loss as he allowed 3 runs in 3 1/3 innings, but the second was better, in Game 4 of the ALCS on October 17th, as he limited the Astros to 2 runs - 1 earned - in 5 innings and New York eventually won the game, 6-4.\n He returned as a member of the Yankees' starting rotation in 2018 even if he had failed to fully live up to expectations after his acquisition. It quickly became evident that he was a weak link in an otherwise very strong Yankees team as he was just 1-2, 6.67 in 6 starts in March/April, and 2-2, 5.16 in May. He pitched somewhat better the next two months, but the fact that they Yankees acquired two veteran starting pitchers at the trading deadline in J.A. Happ and Lance Lynn was definitely not a vote of confidence. In his next start on August 1st, he was hit hard by the lowly Baltimore Orioles, allowing 7 runs in just 2 2/3 innings to be saddled with a loss, and increasing speculation that he may soon be unceremoniously dumped. Even worse, it was revealed that in the wake of recent scandals involving baseball players having made racist or homophobic comments in social media, he had hastily deleted a few posts from his own accounts. The difference was that the earlier incriminated players had made their stupid declaration when they were back in high school, but that Gray's had been made after he had turned professional. The following day, the Yankees announced that Gray would move to the bullpen for the time being, with Lynn taking his starting spot. He did get a chance to make a spot start on August 25th, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Orioles, and this time did well, with 6 1/3 scoreless innings to send the Yank on their way to a 5-1 win and a sweep of the twinbill. He finished the year at 11-9, 4.90, with 23 starts in 30 appearances and 130 1/3 innings pitched. He was not used in the postseason.\n It was clear that Gray was not in the Yankees' plans for 2019, but he was not necessarily easy to trade as the Yanks still wanted to extract a bit of value and not have to swallow all of his remaining contractual obligations. A deal was finally worked out on January 21st, when he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds along with P Reiver Sanmartin in return for infield prospect Shed Long and a Competitive Balance Round A pick in the 2019 amateur draft. The Reds then immediately signed him to a three-year extension through 2022 worth $30.5 million. This deal also reunited him with his former pitching coach at Vanderbilt, Derek Johnson, who was now the Reds' pitching coach. He was an All-Star in his first season with the Reds, going 11-8 with an excellent ERA of 2.87 in 31 starts and a career-high 205 strikeouts in 175 1/3 innings. In 2020, he went 5-3, 3.70 in 11 starts in the season that was cut to just 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic. The Reds made it to the postseason that year, but he did not get to play as he was the third starter behind Trevor Bauer and Luis Castillo and the Reds lost both of their Wild Card Series games against the Atlanta Braves. In 2021, he fell to 7-9, 4.19 as the Reds faded down the stretch and lost what looked to be a certain postseason slot to their division rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals. Sonny made 26 starts and logged 135 1/3 innings, with 155 strikeouts.\n On March 13, 2022, he was traded by the Reds to the Minnesota Twins in return for two prospects, Ps Chase Petty and Francis Peguero. He had two very good seasons for the Twins, going 8-5, 3.08 in 24 starts his first year, and 8-8, 2.79 in 32 starts in 2023. That second second may not have looked remarkable at first glance, but his ERA was the second best in the American League, he led qualifying pitchers in home run rate with just 8 allowed in 184 innings, struck out 183 batters and finished second behind Gerrit Cole in the voting for the 2023 American League Cy Young Award. He helped lead the Twins to a division title, then started Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Toronto Blue Jays on October 4th. He pitched five scoreless innings to earn credit for a 2-0 win that advanced Minnesota to the Division Series, where they faced the Houston Astros. His start in Game 3 on October 10th did not go as well, as he allowed 5 runs in 4 innings and was charged with his team's 9-1 loss.\n Following the 2023 season, Gray became a free agent and on November 27th signed a three-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals"},

His first major league hit was a pinch-hit double off Jeff Samardzija of the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park on June 8th.\n Although drafted in a high round (28th round in the 2015 amateur draft), Garlick made an immediate impression during his first year in the minors, hitting .349 with power, playing for three different teams. He followed that up with a .293/.348/.508 line in 2016 as he continued to move up in the Dodgers system. Still hitting with power in 2017, his batting average dropped under .250, and in 2018 the power continued as he hit .259. In 2019, he was slugging over .600 when called up to the big leagues.  \n Although rookies are often alone on teams of veterans, Garlick found himself in the majors in the spring and summer of 2019 playing alongside other rookie position players such as Matt Beaty, Will Smith and Edwin Rios, all of whom spent part of the season with him on the Oklahoma City Dodgers. In the five games through August 16th the L.A. Dodgers set a major league record by hitting at least four home runs in each game. Garlick did his part by launching a homer in the fourth game of that set.\n One consequence of the high-profile Mookie Betts trade was that Kyle was designated for assignment by the Dodgers. Betts is a right-handed-hitting outfielder, as are Garlick and A.J. Pollock, and the Dodgers presumably decided that they had enough right-handers in the outfield. He was then traded to the Philadelphia Phillies prior to the 2020 season in return for P Tyler Gilbert. The announcement that the National League would use the designated hitter position in a truncated season made it more likely that Kyle would make the Phillies' team.  [1] Kyle did play some for the Phillies, getting into 12 regular-season games, but he hit just .136. As with the Dodgers, he played more left field than right field with the Phils. On September 16th, he was placed on the injured list with an oblique injury. \n In early 2021, he was selected off waivers by the Atlanta Braves.  The next month he was again selected off waivers, this time by the Minnesota Twins, and he played for the Twins in 2022 until he was injured and ended up getting surgery.  In 2022 he started in the minors but was soon up again with the Twins before April was over. \n Because his last name resembles \"garlic\", he is sure to make the \"all food team\", along with others such as Sweetbreads Bailey, Pie Traynor, Candy Cummings, Chicken Wolf, Clarence Beers and a few others."},

He was a third baseman at the time, but has since been switched to the outfield.\n A little league teammate of Bryce Harper, Gallo set a Nevada record with 67 home runs while batting .466. He hit .275/.403/.412 with 10 runs and 10 RBI as junior Team USA's first baseman in the summer of 2011. He fielded .992 and led the team with 15 whiffs in 51 at-bats but also tied for the lead with 10 walks. The US won the junior Pan American Games. As a high school senior the next year, he batted .509 with 21 home runs, 66 runs and 80 RBI. He set a Nevada single-season RBI record and also set the Nevada high school career home run mark (65). \n He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the supplemental first round of the 2012 amateur draft with the 39th overall pick. The pick was compensation for the loss of C.J. Wilson to free agency. It was the second of three first-round selections for Texas, after Lewis Brinson and before Collin Wiles. He soon signed and made his pro debut with the AZL Rangers on June 20th. Not missing a beat in turning pro, he was hitting .292/.485/.771 with 6 home runs, 18 walks, 20 runs and 14 RBI after 15 games. One big problem was his defense, with 8 errors and a .784 fielding percentage at the hot corner.\n In 2013, he led all minor leaguers in home runs with 40, earning the Joe Bauman Award. He played most of the season with Hickory Crawdads of the Carolina League, where he hit .245/.334/.610 with 19 doubles and 38 homers in 106 games. He added a couple more homers in a five-game rehabilitation assignment with the AZL Rangers, finishing with a grand total of 40, and also drove in a total of 88 runs while scoring 86.\n He was again leading the minor leagues in home runs, with 31, when he was selected to play in the 2014 Futures Game at Target Field on July 13th. Starting at DH for the U.S. team, he struck out twice, as is his wont, but also connected for a two-run homer off Michael Feliz in the 6th inning that put the U.S. ahead, 3-2, which would turn out to be the game's final score. He was named winner of the Larry Doby Award as the game's Most Valuable Player in recognition of his performance. He .271/.394/.615 with 42 homers and 106 RBIs in 126 games split between the Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans and AA Frisco Rough Riders. On the down side, he did strike out 179 times, although he also drew 87 walks. He finished second in the minor leagues in home runs, one behind fellow third baseman Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs organization.\n Gallo began the 2015 season back in the minors with Frisco, although it was clear that a call-up was likely sometime during the season. He was hitting .314 with 9 homers and 31 RBIs in 34 games after a slow start when he got the anticipated call on June 1st, after Rangers 3B Adrian Beltre was placed on the disabled list with a sprained left thumb. Facing the Chicago White Sox, he singled off Jeff Samardzija in the 1st inning, driving in two runs, then followed that with a two-run shot to the upper deck off Samardzija in the 3rd and ended his night with a double off the top of the wall in the 5th inning. The Rangers won the game handily, 15-2. he went deep again in his second game, connecting off Zach Duke to lead off the 9th in a 9-2 loss. Not quite ready for stardom, he struck out 43 times in only 98 at-bats in June, and was sent back to the minors at the end of the month. He ended the year at .204 in 36 games with 6 homers and 14 RBIs. With Frisco and the AAA Round Rock Express, he hit .240 in 87 games, with 19 doubles, 23 homers and 63 RBIs.\n In 2016, Gallo spent almost the entire season in the minors with Round Rock, where he played 102 games and put up a batting line of .240/.367/.529 with 25 homers and 66 RBIs. He struck out 150 times while drawing 68 walks and scored 71 times. He also played 17 games with Texas but had only 25 at-bats, hitting .040. In 2017, however, he began the year in the starting line-up because of an injury to Beltre. On April 9th, he had a career-high 5 RBIs in an 8-1 win over the Oakland Athletics, including a three-run homer off Sean Manaea. While he picked up a slew of strikeouts, he made up for this to a large extent by displaying tremendous power, including a number of tape-measure homers. On September 30th, the season's penultimate day, he hit two long balls against the A's to bring his total to 41, becoming the sixth player in Rangers history to reach the mark. In 145 games, he hit .209, with the 41 homers and 80 RBIs and also struck out 196 times. However, thanks to his power and his ability to draw walks - he had 75, his OPS+ was a very good 122 in spite of the low batting average and all the strikeouts.\n He was back doing his thing with the Rangers in 2018. He regularly faced a defensive shift when he came to bat, as an extreme pull hitter who had only one thought in his head: hit the ball as hard as possible to the right side of the field. The Houston Astros took that to an extreme level on May 11th when they 6 of 7 fielders to the right side of the field to defend him, with only LF Marwin Gonzalez defending the other half of the field. The Astros had also successfully tried a shift with a fourth outfielder against him. His final stats that year were almost identical as they had been the year before: 148 games, a .206 average, 40 homers and 92 RBIs. He upped his strikeout total to 207, but also scored 103 runs.\n In a statistical quirk, he had never driven in a run on a sacrifice fly until doing so for the first time on April 21, 2019; he had gone 1,145 at-bats until then, setting a major league record dating back to the introduction of the sac fly as a statistic - and after he broke through, it would take him over two years to hit another one, in September of 2021. On May 8th, he hit his 100th career homer. What was remarkable was that at that point, he had hit only 93 singles, by far the fewest of any player at the time of reaching the 100-homer mark: next on the list was Russell Branyan with 172 and Ken Phelps with 174. he also did this in 377 games, the third fewest ever, behind Ryan Howard at 325 and Ralph Kiner at 376. It was the fewest games in American League history at the time, but the mark was topped by Gary Sanchez later in 2019, when he hit #100 in his 355th game. Joey put everything together in the first half of the season, hitting .275 with 20 homers and 46 RBIs in 61 games for an OPS+ of 178, well above anything he had done until then. This allowed him to be named to the All-Star team for the first time, and explained why the Rangers were surprisingly in the hunt for a wild card at the halfway mark of the season. On July 25th, however, he went on the injured list as he had to undergo surgery on his right wrist; he was complaining of soreness and doctors found a fractured hook on his hamate bone, which was surgically removed. He was in a 1-for-28 slump at the time, with the problem contributing greatly to his hitting woes. He was unable to return after the surgically.\n In 2020, he played 57 games for the Rangers in a season shortened to 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic. His production with the bat was a big disappointment, as he batted just .181 with 8 doubles and 10 homers while striking out 79 times. His OPS+ was only 82. He did have a good year with the glove, however, winning a Gold Glove in right field. It was assumed that he was a poor fielder because he had been moved off third base and was strikeout prone, but he is in fact very athletic with a strong arm. In late June and early July in 2021, he homered in five consecutive games, hitting seven long balls in that stretch to reach the 20-homer mark for the fourth time. He was named to the All-Star team for the second time, but by then trade rumors were swirling around him as it had been reported that he had refused the offer of an extension from the Rangers, and it was assumed that they would prefer to trade him now that his value was high, rather than let him walk away without compensation in a year's time. On July 28th, he was hitting .223 in 95 games, but with 25 homers, 55 RBIs and an AL-leading 74 walks when he was scratched from the starting line-up at the last moment. It did not take long for reporters to confirm that a deal had been struck with the New York Yankees, with Gallo and P Joely Rodriguez going to the Yankees in return for four prospects, none of which was particularly high profile: 2B Ezequiel Duran, 2B Trevor Hauver, P Glenn Otto and SS Josh Smith. The trade still awaited confirmation pending physicals, something which came through shortly thereafter. However, Gallo then failed to hit with New York. He batted .160 in 58 games in 2021, and although he slugged 13 homers, giving him 38 on the year, he also struck out 88 times. In fact, he led the AL in both walks (111) and strikeouts (213). He made his postseason debut in the Wild Card Game against the Boston Red Sox but went 0 for 4 as the Yankees lost the game.\n In 2022, he was slated to be the Yankees' left fielder, with Aaron Hicks in center and Aaron Judge in right, and Giancarlo Stanton as the disignated hitter, but he again failed to hit, and as result lost playing time as the season advanced, event though the Yankees were on a roll and running away with a division title. He hit .159 in 82 games, with 12 homers and 24 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 77. The Yankees had clearly given up on him, and for the second straight year, he was traded at the trading deadline, but this time he was sent away as dead wood on August 2nd, by which time he was in a 6 for 71 skein since mid-June. Interestingly, the team willing to take a chance on his regaining his hitting strike was another contender, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who gave up a low-level prospect in P Clayton Beeter in order to bring him on board. Things did not really go much better for his new team as he batted .162 in 44 games with 7 homers and 23 RBIs. However, he was no longer the target of boo-birds, as the Dodgers were winning and he was buried at the bottom of the batting order. He did appear briefly in the postseason, in one game on defense in the Dodgers' upset loss to the San Diego Padres in the Division Series, but did not come to bat. He became a free agent in the off-season and on December 16th signed a one-year deal with the Minnesota Twins for $11 million in the hope of getting his career back on track.\n He started the 2023 season on a good run with the Twins, hitting 7 homers in April with an OPS above 1.000. However, he went into a very deep slump immediately after that with only 1 hit through his first 8 games in May. He still played good defence and on May 10th made the highlight reel for a tremendous catch that robbed Manny Machado of the San Diego Padres of a double. He made stumbling, sliding grab after a long run in left field, only to see the ball bounce out of his glove as the glove hit the grass. Somehow, the ball did not touch the ground, but bounced upwards, and he managed to snatch it out of the air with his bare hand to complete the catch, all while lying on his back. He then got up and calmly threw to first base to double off Jake Cronenworth, who was convinced the ball had dropped and was standing on second base, for an inning-ending double play. On May 13th, manager Rocco Baldelli used him as his leadoff hitter for the first time of his career, and continued to do so after he went 3 for 10 in his first two games in the role, homering in both games. Overall, he hit .177 in 111 games, with 21 homers and 40 RBIs. He struck out 142 times in 282 at-bats - just over 50% of the time, but still managed to draw 48 walks so his OBP at .301 was not awful, and his OPS+ was at 101. However, he played his last game on September 5th due to a foot injury and he missed the postseason as well.\n Gallo was a free agent again after the 2023 season and on January 23, 2024, it was reported that he had agreed on a one-year deal worth $5 million with the Washington Nationals.\n Gallo grew up in Las Vegas, NV and has known big league slugger Jason Giambi since he was 10 years old. He considers him a mentor as he has regularly talked to him about on and off-field matters, helping him to grow as a hitter and as a person."},

The Rays then took him again in the 13th round of the 2012 amateur draft and he inked a contract for a $100,000 bonus. \n In 2012, he went 4-1 with a 2.40 ERA in 18 relief appearances for the Hudson Valley Renegades. The next year, he was 11-2 with a 1.77 ERA in 23 starts between the Bowling Green Hot Rods and Charlotte Stone Crabs, earning a spot on the Midwest League Mid- and Post-Season All-Star teams and the MiLB.com Organization All-Star squad. In addition, he was named the Rays Minor League Pitcher of the Year. He was 11-13 with a 3.48 ERA in 28 starts for the Montgomery Biscuits in 2014. \n Floro reached the majors with the Rays in the middle of the 2016 season, going 0-1, 4.20 in 12 appearances out of the bullpen. After the season, he was claimed off waivers by the Chicago Cubs and pitched 3 times for them in 2017, with no decisions. he was 3-2, 3.88 in 25 games for the AAA Iowa Cubs, and on August 4th was placed on waivers again and this time was claimed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished the year back in AAA with the Oklahoma City Dodgers. In January of 2018, he signed a free agent contract with the Cincinnati Reds and finally saw some extended action in the majors, pitching 25 times with a 3-2 record and a 2.72 ERA. On July 4th, he was traded back to the Dodgers along with Zach Neal and international bonus pool money in return for Ps James Marinan and Aneurys Zabala. Both Floro and Neal had been recent members of the Dodgers organization. On August 18th, he lost a game in an unusual manner when he committed a \"walk-off balk\" against the Seattle Mariners. It came with one out in the 10th inning with the bases loaded and the game tied at 4; Floro flinched during his delivery allowing Cameron Maybin to score from third base. First base umpire Andy Fletcher called the play. Still, his combined record for the season was a solid 6-3, 2.25 in 54 games and he got to play in the postseason for the first time. He was particularly good in the Dodgers' win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, making 5 appearances without giving up a run in 4 1/3 innings. In the World Series, however, he was charged with the loss in Game 4 on October 27th. Closer Kenley Jansen had just blown a lead in the 8th inning and the score was 4-4 when he started the top of the 9th against the Boston Red Sox, but after getting Eduardo Nunez to pop out, things fell a part as he gave up a double to Brock Holt, a run-scoring single to Rafael Devers, and then after getting Blake Swihart to ground out, was asked to issue an intentional walk to Mookie Betts before turning the ball over the Alex Wood. The Dodgers were still in the game at that point, but Wood and Kenta Maeda failed to retire any of the next four batters and by the time the inning ended, Boston had built an insurmountable 9-4 lead.\n In 2019, his numbers were not as good as he went 5-3, 4.24 in 50 games and was not used in the postseason. But he bounced back well in 2020, going 3-0, 2.59 in 25 games during the pandemic-shortened season. This time, he did see work in the postseason, making a total of 6 appearances as the Dodgers won their first World Series title since 1988. He wasn't as his best in the final round, though, as he gave up 2 runs in 2 outings against the Tampa Bay Rays, although he did not figure in any of the decisions. Following the season, on February 12, 2021, he was traded to the Miami Marlins for Ps Kyle Hurt and Alex Vesia."},

The number of plate appearances he has gotten has gone up each of his first three seasons. Although primarily a catcher in the minors, he has only rarely been used as a catcher in the majors - the Dodgers used him mostly as a pinch-hitter and third baseman, while the Cincinnati Reds used him primarily at second base. He found home run power in 2019, after hitting no home runs with the Los Angeles Dodgers during partial seasons in 2017 and 2018.\n Kyle had a memorable major league debut for the Dodgers. He came to bat as a pinch-hitter in the 11th inning of the nationally-televized Sunday night game against the San Francisco Giants on July 30, 2017, with the Dodgers trailing 2-1 at home. Corey Seager had hit a one-out double and Justin Turner had been walked intentionally before Kyle came to bat against Albert Suarez. He lined a pitch down the right-field line for a double, scoring both runners and giving his team a walk-off 3-2 win. He had been called up three days earlier to take the place of P Grant Dayton on the roster. He played just 20 major league games that season, hitting .300 with 2 RBIs, but was still added to the postseason roster, going 0 for 4 with an RBI while playing in the first two series. However, he was dropped for the World Series.\n In 2018, he again saw only limited action at the major league level, given the Dodgers still had both Yasmani Grandal and Austin Barnes to share catching duties. In fact, in 39 games, he saw most of his action at third base. He hit .235 with 9 RBIs and was not on the postseason roster. After the season, on December 21st, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with OFs Matt Kemp and Yasiel Puig and P Alex Wood in return for P Homer Bailey, who was immediately released by L.A., and two prospects, in a deal designed to clear roster and salary space for the Dodgers. With the Reds in 2019, he played 97 games, hitting .230 with 9 homers and 27 RBIs, good power numbers since he had just 183 at-bats. His most frequent position was second base, but he played every infield position, pitcher and catcher - but not a single game in the outfield. His lone pitching appearance came on August 8th in a 12-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs; he gave up a hit but no runs in 1 1/3 innings.\n In 2020 he was back with the Reds in a back-up role when the season finally started at the end of July. He appeared in 32 of the 60 games played by the team that season, hitting .266 in 64 at-bats. He went 0 for 5 in the only game he played in the postseason, as the Reds were swept by the Atlanta Braves in two games in the Wild Card Series. In 2021, He took over as the regular at shortstop for Cincinnati, hitting .263 in 147 games, with 16 homers and 63 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 88, his Achilles' heel being a low walk rate (just 22 in 529 plate appearances). He had a similar season for what was now a sinking Reds team in 2022, with 145 games played, an average of .255 (with an OBP of .315), 14 homers and 78 RBIs. His OPS+ improved slightly, to 90, but it was essentially the same season as in 2021, excet that he played a few more games at third base and a few less at short.\n On November 18, 2022, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins in return for minor leaguer Casey Legumina. He started the 2023 season as a quasi-regular utility player, seeing time at second base, third base and first base (shortstop was taken care of by the teams' best player, Carlos Correa). He was hitting .226 with 6 runs in 11 games when on April 12th, he was hit flush in the face by a fastball thrown by Lucas Giolito in the 4th inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox. He had to leave the game immediately and was placed on the injured list as he required a procedure to have his teeth realigned, but had managed to escape without fracturing his jaw, which would have put him on the shelf for an extended period."},

The Twins exploited this by devising a special entrance montage for him, complete with turning out the lights at the ballpark and playing the sound of crackling flames on the public address system while pictures of flames ran around the concourse. And while there were plenty of pitchers throwing very hard that season, he did something completely unprecedented on August 29th when he reached triple digits - on a breaking ball. His \"off-speed\" pitch, which he calls a \"splinker\" (a cross between a splitter and a sinker) was timed at 100.8 mph in a game against the Boston Red Sox. The next day, starter Dylan Bundy brought a custom-made cake to the dugout, with the radar gun reading in the frosting, to celebrate the feat, making good on a promise made in a post-game interview when asked about the pitch (\"He deserves a cake\" was Bundy's response). Duran dispatched with the middle of Boston's batting order on 14 pitches that day at a key moment of the ballgame to earn his 17th hold, in addition to 6 saves up to that point and an ERA of 1.91.

On January 23, 2017, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays in return for 2B Logan Forsythe. He only made one appearance for the Rays that season, giving up 3 runs in 2 2/3 innings in a relief appearance against the Texas Rangers on May 29th. He was still credited with a 10-8 win. Health issues limited to just 10 games in the minors, as he went on the disabled list on three separate occasions. Three of his appearances came on a rehabilitation assignment with the GCL Rays. He went 2-2, 3.05, pitching well when he was healthy. In spring training in 2018, health issues came back with a vengeance as he was diagnosed in early March with a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow. He was the second Rays' top pitching prospect to suffer such an injury that spring, following Brent Honeywell, who had been shut down for the season two weeks earlier. He underwent Tommy John surgery, which was performed by noted physician Dr. James Andrews.\n He pitched the game of a lifetime on March 13, 2023, starting for the Puerto Rican national team against Israel at the 2023 World Baseball Classic at [LoanDepot Park]] in Miami, FL.

Even in a draft with no consensus top pick, Correa's selection was considered a bit of a dark horse, as he had not featured in speculation about the eventual top choice. He strongly impressed Astros' officials in late workouts before the draft and they compared him to a young Alex Rodriguez and center fielder Carlos Beltran, the best position player to emerge out of Puerto Rico in the last two decades. Correa was a product of Major League Baseball's efforts to foster the rebirth of baseball in neglected urban areas. He had played in the \"Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI)\" program from the age of 10, and most recently was attending the Urban Youth Academy's Puerto Rico Branch. Fellow first-rounder Jesmuel Valentin was also in that program, as were two other players drafted in later rounds.\n Contrary to most top selections in recent years, Correa reached a quick agreement. On June 6th, barely two days after the draft, owner Jim Crane announced that he had reached a verbal agreement with the youngster, and that a formal announcement only awaited a physical exam, putting him on track to sign and take part in a pre-game workout the following day. His signing bonus was reported to be $4.2 million, well under the $7.2 million target outlined by MLB for the draft's top pick. He was to return to Puerto Rico to attend his high school graduation, then report to the Astros' spring training complex in Kissimmee, FL before starting his professional career with the GCL Astros. In his pro debut, he hit second and played short in a 1-0, 13-inning win over the GCL Cardinals on June 18th. He singled and stole second in his first plate appearance and finished one for five with a walk, steal and error for the day. His 2014 season was cut short when he fractured his fibula just above his right ankle in June. He hurt his leg sliding into third base on a triple while playing for the Lancaster JetHawks of the California League on June 21st. As a result, he played only 62 games, hitting a solid .325/.416/.510, with the caveat that Lancaster was possibly the most hitter-friendly environment in organized baseball. His injury came at the same time as the Astros' other two overall number 1 picks were also experiencing difficulties, with Mark Appel struggling on the mound at Lancaster and Brady Aiken failing to sign with the team after being the top pick in the 2014 draft. This led observers to wonder if the Astros had really received all the bang they could have from their years of finishing in last place.\n Correa was back on the fast track to the bigs at the start of 2015, as no one expected his injury to have lasting ill effects. All major prospect ranking organizations ranked him either third or fourth heading into the season, and he was assigned to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the AA Texas League to start the year. He absolutely tore up the circuit, batting .385 with 7 homers and 32 RBI in 29 games to earn a promotion to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies in mid-May. He hit .266 in 23 games, when the Astros, finding themselves in first place in the AL West, decided to call him up on June 8th. In 52 minor league games, he amassed an amazing 21 doubles, 10 homers, 43 runs scored and 43 RBI; he also was successful on 18 of 19 stolen bases attempts.  \n Carlos made his debut as the Astros' starting shortstop against the Chicago White Sox on June 8th, getting one of only five hits off Chris Sale and driving in his team's only run in a 3-1 loss. He was the youngest player in the major leagues at that point. More milestones came in his his second game, on June 9th, as he stole his first base and connected for his first home run, a two-run 9th-inning shot off Zach Duke in a 4-2 loss to the Sox. He also homered in his first game at Minute Maid Park, going deep off Joe Beimel of the Seattle Mariners in a 10-0 win. He showed another facet of his talent on June 18th when he stole three bases in a win over the Colorado Rockies; he was the second-youngest player ever to pull off the feat, after Rickey Henderson. He was named the American League Rookie of the Month for June, after hitting .287 with 9 doubles, 5 homers and 15 RBI, even after not making his debut until a week was gone in the month. He finished the season with a .279/.345/.512 line, 22 doubles and 22 homers in 99 games. He went 0-for-4 in the Wild Card Game, then in the Division Series, he hit .350 with 2 homers as the Astros lost in five games to the Kansas City Royals. After the season, he was voted the American League Rookie of the Year, finishing ahead of Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians. In 2016, Carlos became the youngest Astro to homer on Opening Day, crafting a fine .274/.361/.451 line in his first full season (153 games), belting 20 home runs and driving in 96 runs. He led the majors in walk-off hits, belting four. \n He was very effective for the Puerto Rican national team that finished second in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, with homers off Jhoulys Chacin, Jordan Romano and Rick van den Hurk and hitting .333/.500/.750 with 10 runs and 9 RBI in 8 games. He was named the event's All-Star third baseman as Lindor was the shortstop for Puerto Rico (and also made the All-Star team). He tied Wladimir Balentien for the tourney lead in runs, tied for 2nd in homers (with John Andreoli, Alfredo Despaigne, Nelson Cruz, Sho Nakata and Yoshitomo Tsutsugo, one behind Balentien), was 2nd in RBI (3 behind Balentien), tied Despaigne for 3rd in total bases and tied for 4th with two steals (even with Kosuke Tanaka, Eddie Rosario and Dalton Pompey). Had Puerto Rico won, he would have likely been a MVP candidate, but the award went to Marcus Stroman of the victorious USA.\n Correa was named the American League Player of the Month in May 2017, after hitting .386 with 24 runs scored, 8 doubles, 7 home runs and 26 RBI; not coincidentally, the Astros finished the month with the best record in the majors. He was voted the starting shortstop at the All-Star Game, playing alongside his double play partner, José Altuve, as well as center fielder George Springer. On July 18th, he went on the disabled list with torn ligaments in his left thumb, an injury sustained while swinging the bat the previous day. The Astros had their worst month in August in his absence, but he returned on September 3rd, collecting an RBI single in an 8-6 win over the New York Mets that completed a three-game sweep in the team's return to Minute Maid Park after having been temporarily displaced by Hurricane Harvey. On September 27-28, he had back-to-back four-hit games, topping the second, a 12-2 win over the Boston Red Sox, with his 24th homer of the year as he finished the year on a torrid streak. He ended up at .315/.391/.550 in 109 games, with 24 homers and 84 RBI in addition to 82 runs scored. He was a key figure in the Astros' conquest of the first World Series title in their history, as he banged 21 hits in 73 at bats (.288) with 5 doubles, 5 homers, 10 runs scored and 14 RBI during the three rounds of the postseason. In the World Series, he hit a pair of homers in Houston's seven-game triumph over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n Carlos was very involved in efforts by ballplayers hailing from Puerto Rico to provide assistance following the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. In fact, he skipped the Astros' visit to the White House on March 12, 2018, when they met President Donald Trump.  There was speculation this was a political gesture directed against the President's contemptuous comments about the island in the wake of the storm (teammate Carlos Beltran, who is also from Puerto Rico, skipped the event as well), but he simply wanted to take the day off to provide practical help to his countrymen. He spent the day gathering relief supplies to send to the island, explaining that as an American citizen from Puerto Rico, it was his responsibility to bring awareness to the continuing suffering experienced by the islanders. He again missed time in 2018, playing 110 games but missing all of July and parts of June and August as well due to lower back soreness. The injury depressed his batting average and sapped his power, as he only hit two long balls after his return, including one in his last game before the postseason, on September 29th. He hit just .239/.323/.405 as a result, with 15 homers and 65 RBI. He was only 1-for-10 in the Division Series win over the Cleveland Indians, his only hit being a homer, but bounced back to go 6-for-19 in a losing cause in the ALCS, where the Astros were defeated by the Boston Red Sox in 6 games.\n He was back at an elite level at the start of the 2019 season, as in his first 50 games, he hit .295 with 11 homers and 35 RBI while the Astros were running away with the AL West title. The injury bug bit him again, in a most unusual way; on May 29th he was placed on the injured list after suffering a broken rib during a massage at home. He missed almost exactly two months, playing only 75 games with a .279/.358/.568 line, 21 homers and 59 RBI. Though his hitting line was far from robust in the postseason, he did belt a couple of big home runs, including a walk-off in the ALCS against the New York Yankees. The Astros fell in seven games to the Washington Nationals but their troubles were just beginning with the revelation they had been stealing signs for much of the magical 2017 season. For his part, Correa issued a sincere apology for his partaking as Houston entered the 2020 season public enemy number one. That season was of course shortened to just 60 games by the Coronavirus pandemic, but the Astros escaped a lot of opprobrium because these games were played without spectators present. He appeared in 58 of these games and hit .264 with 5 homers and 25 RBIs, well below his usual standards as his OPS+ was 93 - the lowest of his career. The Astros barely made it into the expanded postseason, but then got hot when things got serious, and Correa was again a leader with the bat, hitting .500 in each of the first two rounds of the postseason. That was unsustainable over the long run, but he still went 7 for 27 with 1 double and 2 homers in the Astros' loss to the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS, for an overall line of 17 for 47 (.362) with 6 homers and 17 RBIs in 13 games.\n In 2021, Correa had a bounceback season with the Astros, batting .279 with 34 doubles, 26 homers, 104 runs and 82 RBIs. He also drew 75 walks and his OPS+ shot back up all the way to 130. A number of honors followed, includeing a second All-Star nod, a first Gold Glove, and a 5th-place finish in the MVP vote - the highest finish of his career. The Astros shook off the doldrums from their previous regular season to win the division title and once again made it to the ALCS - their fifth straight appearance there. He hit a sparkling .385 in the Division Series against the Chicago White Sox and scored 5 runs in their win over the Boston Red Sox that took them to face the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. He had another 6 hits in the Fall Classic, along with 4 RBIs, but the Astros were defeated in six games. These turned out to be Carlos's last games as a member of the Astros, as he was one of a number of top-ranked shortstops to become free agents after the season. He had not found a new home when the 2021-2022 lockout brought transactions to a halt on December 1st, and it was not until March 18th that he found a new home, as the Astros were not prepared to meet his demands, in a situation similar to what had befallen OF George Springer a year before. Correa ended up signing a three-year deal with the Minnesota Twins worth $105 million, with an option to opt out after the first season.\n Correa decided to exercise his opt-out option after hitting .291 in 136 games for Minnesota, with 24 doubles, 22 homers, 70 runs and 64 RBIs. His OPS+ was 140. The Twins missed the postseason, but they were satisfied with Correa's performance, even if he was not an MVP contender as had been the case in some of his best seasons with Houston. For his part, he bet that the market for his services would be more dynamic without a potential lock-out on the horizon. He won that bet handily, as teams were in a spending mode following the 2022 season. On December 13th, after Aaron Judge, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts had defined the top end of the free agent market for position players, he signed a massive 13-year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth $350 million - the largest ever given out by the Giants. It was also the largest contract ever given a shortstop, topping the $341 million given the Francisco Lindor, and the longest free agent contract in terms of years, tied with that of Bryce Harper. While the Giants already had a shortstop under contract in Brandon Crawford, he was already 36 years old and coming off a poor season. As is usually the case with these unofficial signing announcements, there is a caveat that the deal is still subject to a physical exam and has not been officially confirmed by the two parties, but in almost all cases, the terms are made official within days. However, this one was the exception: on December 20th, the deal fell apart over an undisclosed issue revealed by the physical exam, as a press conference scheduled to introduce Correa to the local media was hastily canceled. Then something even rarer occurred when another team, the New York Mets, immediately swooped in and signed Correa for 12 years and $315 million - also subject to a physical examination. With Francisco Lindor entrenched at shortstop, the Mets were looking for Correa to play third base for them. And the Mets' physical exam also did turn up an issue - likely the same one as the Twins' - concerning Correa's ankle that seemingly dated back to the injury that had cut short his 2014 season when he was still in the minors. The question now was whether this issue would also completely derail the second deal too. While talks between the Mets and Correa dragged on, the Twins reportedly jumped back into the mix and were looking to make an offer should the deal with the Mets fall completely through. And that is exactly what happened on January 10, 2023 when they offered him a deal for $200 million over six years - but still pending a physical exam... That hurdle was cleared the next day, however, making the deal official and ending the bizarre saga.\n Correa had an injury-plagued season with the Twins in 2023, hitting .230 in 135 games for the lowest batting average of his career by a wide margin. He hit 18 homers and drove in 65 runs, again figures below his usual standards, and his OPS+ was 94 while he led the American League in grounding into double plays with 30. But his contributions to the team were still important, as he was the veteran leader on a young squad that won a division title handily. He was at his best in the two-game sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays in the Wild Card Series that broke a record streak of 18 straight postseason losses: in Game 1 on October 3rd, he threw out Bo Bichette at the plate in one of the game's key plays, and the next day he drove in the first run with a bases-loaded single off Yusei Kikuchi in the 4th inning, then surprised Vladimir Guerrero Jr. at second base on a scripted pick-off play with P Sonny Gray that took the Twins out of a jam in the 5th inning. The Twins won the two games by scores of 3-1 and 2-0, so his contributions were essential.\n Carlos's younger brother, second baseman Jean Carlos Correa, also attended the Puerto Rican Baseball Academy and, in 2017, joined Alvin Community College in the Houston area. He was drafted by the Astros in the 38th round in the 2019 amateur draft."},

He made his big league debut in 2015.\n Buxton hit .513 with 17 doubles and 38 steals as a high school senior while going 10-0 with 154 strikeouts in 81 innings as a pitcher.  On May 31, 2012, he struck out 18 to help his team win its first state title.  He had been timed at 6.6 seconds in the 60-yard dash as well.  His athleticism also shone through on the football field, where he was an All-State receiver and defensive back with a football scholarship offer to the University of Georgia.  All that was enough to convince the Minnesota Twins to pick him second overall in the 2012 amateur draft, one selection after Carlos Correa of Puerto Rico.  He signed for a $6 million bonus and made his pro debut with the GCL Twins on June 22nd, going 0-for-4.  He also played for the Elizabethton Twins that first season, finishing with a combined batting line of .248/.344/.448 in 48 games.\n In 2013, Buxton began the year with the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Class A Midwest League where he hit an excellent .341 in 68 games.  At midseason, he was promoted to the advanced Class A Fort Myers Miracle of the Florida State League, but did not slow down much, as he hit .326 in 57 games.  Between the two, his batting line was .334/.424/.520 in 120 games, with 109 runs scored, 19 doubles, 18 triples, 12 homers, 77 RBI and 55 steals.  Those eye-popping numbers resulted in his being ranked the #1 prospect in all of baseball by Baseball America prior to the 2014 season.  He was in spring training with the Twins and, while there was speculation he would be in the majors before the All-Star break, he was sent back to Fort Myers to begin the season.  Even more surprising, he seemed to lose his batting stroke there, as he hit only .240 in 30 games, losing a lot of playing time to various injuries.  After a couple of strong performances in early August, the Twins promoted him to AA on August 11th, assigning him to the New Britain Rock Cats of the Eastern League.  In his first game for his new team, he suffered a concussion and had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance as he collided with right fielder Mike Kvasnicka in the 5th inning.  He was unconscious for 10 minutes following the jarring collision.  Although he did not suffer any fractures, the Twins decided to play it safe and announced that Buxton would not return that season.  Buxton headed to the Arizona Fall League after his truncated 2014 season, but the injury bug found him there as well.  On October 27th, he broke a finger on his right hand while diving to catch a sinking line drive.\n Even with the lost season, he still entered 2015 as the #1 prospect in baseball for the second straight year.  He was assigned to the AA Chattanooga Lookouts, where he was hitting .283 with 12 triples, 6 home runs, 44 runs scored and 37 RBI in 59 games when he got the call to the majors on June 14th, as the Twins were short on outfielders.  He made his big league debut a week after Carlos Correa, who had been drafted ahead of him in 2012.  His debut against the Texas Rangers was successful, as he scored the winning run in the 9th inning despite going 0 for 4.  Playing center field and hitting 9th, he reached on a fielder's choice then scored on a double by Eddie Rosario to give Minnesota the winning margin in a 4-3 win that snapped a five-game losing streak.  The next day, he hit a triple for his first major league hit, but also slammed into the center field wall at Busch Stadium in an attempt to catch a triple off the bat of Randal Grichuk in a 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.  He managed to escape serious injury this time.  But the injury bug would not spare him long: on June 26th, he was placed on the disabled list with a sprained left thumb.  He was hitting .189 after 11 games.  He came back on August 20th and, two days later, collected his first career RBI, a tie-breaking 7th-inning single in a 3-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles.  He hit .209 in 46 games that first season, with 2 homers and only 6 RBI.\n Buxton's sophomore season was a big disappointment, as the Twins were expecting him to take a big step forward, but he continued to struggle at the plate in the majors in 2016.  In 92 games with the last-place team, he hit only .225, with an OBP of .284, adding 10 homers and 38 RBI.  His control of the strike zone was very poor, with 23 walks but 118 strikeouts.  He continued to struggle in the first half of 2017, hitting just .216 with 5 homers and 16 RBI in 83 games.  The Twins were playing much better and he was contributing to their success with great defense, which explains why he was in the lineup every day despite the underwhelming bat.  He showed the first hints of being a solid major league hitter that August, when he seemed to find his power stroke.  On August 27th, he had the first three-homer game of his career, victimizing the Toronto Blue Jays in a 7-2 Twins win.  He connected off Joe Biagini with a two-run shot in the 4th, after having driven in a run with a single in the 1st.  He then led off the 7th with a long ball off Matt Dermody and added another solo shot in the 9th against Tim Mayza.  Overall, he scored 4 runs, drove in 5 and added a stolen base, capping a three-game series in which he went 7-for-13 as the Twins continued to hang on, unexpectedly, to a potential wild card spot in the American League.  On September 14th, he hit a walk-off homer into the second deck at Target Field off Luis Santos in the 10th inning to give Minnesota a 3-2 win over the Blue Jays.  His great second half meant that he finished the season at .253 with 16 homers, 69 runs scored and 51 RBI in 140 games.  He also won the Gold Glove as the American League's best defensive center fielder.  The Twins made it to the postseason as the second wild card team and Byron started the Wild Card Game against the New York Yankees on October 3rd.  He went 0 for 2 but drove in the tying run with a force out against David Robertson in the 3rd and then proceeded to steal second base.  The score was 4-4 at that point, but he was stranded on base, and in the 4th inning he had to leave the game in favor of Zack Granite because of an injury.  The Twins went on to lose the game, 8-4.\n In 2018, he started the season hitting just .195 through his first 11 games, going on the disabled list on April 18th, retroactive to April 15th, complaining of recurrent migraine headaches. He was on a rehabilitation assignment with the Fort Myers Miracle on April 22nd when he fouled a ball off his toe. X-rays showed a hairline fracture, putting him on the shelf for an extended period.  He ended up playing just 28 games, during which he hit .156. He bounced back in a remarkable manner in 2019 as he played 73 games during the first half and hit .253 with 24 doubles and 9 homers. The injury bug bit him again in the second half, when he played just 14 games. On September 10th, his season was officially over as the Twins placed him on the 60-day injured list to undergo surgery for a torn labrum in his left shoulder. He finished the year at .262/.314/.513, good for an OPS+ of 114, by far the best offensive performance of his career. He continued to hit well in 2020, even though he again missed significant time, playing 37 of the Twins' 60 games in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. His OPS+ was 126 as he hit .234 but with 13 homers in just 130 at-bats, scoring 19 runs and driving in 37. In spite of his limited playing time, he received some consideration on the MVP ballot, finishing 16th. He played in the postseason for the second time, going 1 for 4 in the Twins' loss to the Houston Astros in the Wild Card Series, starting Game 1 one and pinch-running in Game 2.\n He started the 2021 season as one of the hottest hitters in the majors, going 13 for 27 with 4 doubles and 5 homers in his first 8 games. He kept it up for the entire month, being named the American League Player of the Month for April on the strength of a .426 average with 8 homers, 14 RBIs and 15 runs scored in 18 games. No Twins player had won the award since Delmon Young in 2010. However, the injury bug bit him again, as he played only three games from May 7 to August 27, missing two-thirds of the season. He was hitting .370 when he first went down, and finished the season at .306 in 61 games and 235 at-bats. In spite of all the time missed, he slugged 23 doubles and 19 homers, good for a slugging percentage of .647 and an OPS+ of 171. There was no question that he was one of the best and most exciting players in baseball when he was in the line-up, but the doubt was whether he would ever be healthy enough to showcase his considerable talent. The Twins made a bet that his health would hold up, as on November 28th they signed him to a seven-year contract extension worth $100 million, with a lot of incentives built in: the deal only guaranteed him $9 million the first year and $15 per season after that, but with large potential bonuses for plate appearances and for a high finish in the MVP voting. \n He began 2022 with a hoy first week, going 5 for 23 with all the hits going for extra base, then led off the game of April 15th against the Boston Red Sox with a double, but as he slid into second base, he banged the ground in frustration and was immediately removed from the game. While he was not visibly limping, it was announced that he had suffered a knee injury, and everyone couldn't help but think \"Here we go again!\" However, there was some good news as an MRI came back negative and Byron was back in the line-up on April 21st. On April 24th, he hit what was billed as the longest walk-off homer on record when his second long ball of the game was a 469-foot blast against Liam Hendriks in the 10th inning for a 6-4 win against the Chicago White Sox. He drove in 5 of his team's 6 runs in the game, giving him 6 homers and 11 RBIs in 10 games, and a .946 slugging percentage. On June 28th, he hit his 20th homer of the season to reach the mark for the first time. What was strange about this was that he had now hit 52 homers in his last 162 games, but because of injuries this stretch had started back in 2019, preventing him - until now - from hitting 20 in any one season. The 52 homers were the third most in franchise history in such a span, bested only by Hall of Famer and franchise icon Harmon Killebrew and former teammate Nelson Cruz. On July 4th, he started an unprecedented 8-5 triple play in center field when he caught a fly ball by A.J. Pollock of the Chicago White Sox while running at full tilt towards the fence, then turned around and whirled the ball to 3B Gio Urshela. Both White Sox runners were caught well off their bad, with Urshela tagging Yoan Moncada, who had been on first base, between second and third and then continuing on to step on second base to erase Adam Engel who had already rounded third and had no way to get back to his base. He was limited to 92 games, but this was still tied for second-most in his eight seasons to date. His 28 homers were easily a personal best, and his 51 RBIs tied the number he had produced in 2017 - in 140 games. He scored 61 runs and in spite of a batting average of .224, his OPS+ was 133.\n In 2023, the Twins decided to move him to DH on an almost permanent basis in order to preserve his body from injuries, and not because of any defensive shortcomings. in a way, this was similar to the Milwaukee Brewers deciding to make a full-time DH of Paul Molitor, whose career was also threatened by repeated injuries; the move had paid off in that case, helping Molitor to a Hall of Fame career, and the Twins were hoping for a similar outcome as well. Carlos Correa was the one who had talked to Buxton to convince him that this was what was best for him in the longer term. On June 22nd, against the Boston Red Sox, he did something unprecedented since the advent of Statcast in 2015 by hitting two homers over 465 feet in the same game. The two long balls were hit at Target Field in support of Joe Ryan, who threw the first complete game shutout by a Twins pitcher since 2018 in a 6-0 win. His two victims were both rookies, Justin Garza and Brandon Walter. However, he was injured again when the postseason came around, and he had to watch from the bench as the Twins finally ended a 19-year drought without a postseason win when they swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series. He had ended the season at .207 in 85 games, with 17 homers and 42 RBIs, and had played his last game on August 1st, after which he was sidelined by a knee injury.\n Source: MLB.com"},

His grandfather Joe Balazovic pitched in the minors. [1]\n Balazovic pitched nine shutout innings for the Canadian junior team when they visited the Dominican Republic in 2016. [2] Baseball America ranked him as the top Canadian high schooler entering the 2016 amateur draft. [3] The Minnesota Twins took him in the 5th round of the 2016 amateur draft. He was the 5th Canadian taken that year and the second Canadian out of high school, after Andy Yerzy. [4] The Twins scout was Walt Burrows. [5] \n In his pro debut, he was 2-1 with a save, 1.97 ERA and .217 opponent average for the GCL Twins. In 2017, he fell to 1-3, 4.91 with the same club. He moved up to the Cedar Rapids Kernels in 2018 and posted a 7-3, 3.94 record with 78 K in 61 2/3 IP. The 20-year-old made the 2019 Futures Game, relieving Brady Singer in the 7th with a 2-0 deficit for the AL. He retired Daulton Varsho and Gavin Lux before Cristian Pache reached on an error. Balazovic picked off Pache to end the inning. After the AL scored twice in the bottom of the inning, Grayson Rodriguez replaced Balazovic. [6] At the time, his fastball usually hit the mid-90s and his slider was noted as an effective pitch. [7]\n For the summer, he was at 2-1, 2.18 in 4 games for Cedar Rapids and 6-4, 2.84 in 15 for the Fort Myers Miracle, striking out 129 in 93 2/3 innings between the two stops and posting a .98 WHIP. He tied for 3rd among Twins farmhands in wins and was 3rd in Ks (behind Jhoan Duran and Bryan Sammons, each of whom had significantly lower K/9 rates). He led full-season Twins minor leaguers in K/9 in fact. He missed some time when he joined Team Canada for the 2019 Pan American Games. In his only start, he struggled against Cuba, going 3 2/3 innings and allowing five hits, four runs, a walk and two homers (to Raúl González and Yunior Ibarra) while striking out one before Ryan Kellogg relieved with a 4-4 score; Canada would go on to win the game and would finish the Games with a Silver Medal. Only Ben Abram and Jasvir Rakkar had higher ERAs for Canada. [8]\n After sitting out the 2020 season because the minor leagues were shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, he was with the AA Wichita Wind Surge in 2021, going 5-4, 3.62 in 20 starts and logging 97 innings. In 22, he had a frustrating first season in AAA with the St. Paul Saints, going 0-7, 7.68 in 23 games including 21 starts. He also made one appearance on a rehabilitation assignment in the Florida State League. That tough season likely cost him a spot on the Canadian team for the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Things were better at the start of the 2023 season as he slid over to a relief role with St. Paul. Only 3 of his first 14 appearances were as a starter, and he was 1-1, 4.79 when he got the call to Minnesota in mid-June. He made his debut on June 18th, pitching against the Detroit Tigers in relief of Louie Varland, who lasted 4 1/3 innings. He completed the 5th and pitched three more innings, not giving up any runs, but the Twins had fallen in a 6-1 hole and were unable to climb out of it in spite of his solid work."},

He soon signed, and he made his pro debut that summer with the AZL Diamondbacks. He also pitched for the Missoula Osprey of the Pioneer League that first year, combining for a record of 2-4, 8.58, the 22 runs he allowed in 13 1/3 innings in Missoula being responsible for the very high ERA. He began the 2015 season with the Kane County Cougars of the Midwest League. He was 2-2, 3.69 after 7 starts when on June 20th, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with veteran starting pitcher Bronson Arroyo in return for IF Philip Gosselin. Toussaint was clearly the prize that convinced the Braves to take on the rather large salary due to the injured Arroyo.\n He was named to the World Team for the 2018 Futures Game as a late replacement for Francisco Mejia, who had been called up to the majors the day before the game was to take place. While born in the United States, he was representing Haiti at the game, the country from which his parents emigrated. He was called up to the majors on August 13, 2018 to start the first game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins. He had an excellent outing, giving up just a run on 2 hits in 6 innings as Atlanta won the game, 9-1, on its way to sweeping the twin bill. He made 7 appearances, including 5 starts for the Braves, and did well overall, going 2-1, 4.03, with just 18 hits allowed in 29 innings. He had very good stuff, but did not have full control of it, as evidenced by his 32 strikeouts and 21 walks. In the minors, he went 9-6, 2.38 in 24 starts between AA and AAA. Still, the Braves put him on their postseason roster, and he received credit for their only win of the Division Series, a 6-5 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 on October 7th. He actually pitched better in a loss in Game, tossing two hitless and scoreless innings during which he walked 2 batters and struck out as many. In his winning appearance, he was Atlanta's fourth pitcher of the game, following starter Sean Newcomb and relievers Kevin Gausman and Max Fried. He took over in the 6th with the score tied at 5, and while he loaded the bases on a double and a pair of walks, he managed to get Chris Taylor to ground out to third to end the inning, after which Freddie Freeman led off the bottom of the 6th with a homer, which turned out to account for the final run of the game.\n In 2019, he pitched 24 times for Atlanta, with just one start, going 4-0, 5.62 and logging 41 2/3 innings. His control improved somewhat, as he walked 26 batters while striking out 45 men. He also made 10 starts in AAA with the Gwinnett Stripers, but was hit hard, to the tune of a 7.49 ERA and a record of 1-6; he allowed 51 hits and 28 walks in 39 2/3 innings, leading to a plethora of runs allowed. He did not pitch in the postseason that year. In 2020, when training camp resumed in July, he was one of a number of Braves players to test positive for COVID-19 and was kept away from the rest of the team until July 17th as a result."},

Ramírez had hit a double and when he slid head-first into second base, between SS Tim Anderson's legs, he was tagged particularly hard even though he was safe. When he got up, he began arguing with the Chicago White Sox player, who had raised the Guardians' anger with other gestures they considered unsportsmanlike earlier in the series, and the two exchanged punches. This led to a massive bench-clearing brawl that took fifteen minutes to clear up, and by the time the dust had settled, Ramírez and Anderson, as well as both managers and two other persons, had been tossed for their role in the fracas. That was how Tena came into the game, and he then came in to score on a single by Kole Calhoun. He remained in the game at shortstop, going 0 for 2 in the 7-4 win."},

The choice was compensation for Toronto's failure to sign James Paxton, a 2009 first-rounder. Syndergaard was the Jays' third first-round selection after Deck McGuire and Aaron Sanchez, also pitchers.\n The right-hander finished his senior year of high school by going 7-3 with an ERA of 1.40 and had 85 strikeouts in 59 innings. He was not listed as one of Baseball America's top 200 prospects heading into the 2010 Amateur Draft. He made his pro debut with the GCL Blue Jays on July 12th with two hitless, walkless, scoreless innings against the GCL Pirates. He only pitched 5 times as a pro that season, with a 2.70 ERA in 13 1/3 innings. He played for three teams in 2011 - the Bluefield Blue Jays, Vancouver Canadians and Lansing Lugnuts - compiling a record of 5-2, 1.83 in 13 games and 59 innings. In 2012, he spent the entire season at Lansing in the Midwest League, where he was 8-5, 2.60 in 27 games, striking out 122 in 103 2/3 innings. On December 17th, he was one of two key prospects sent by the Blue Jays to the New York Mets - the other being C Travis d'Arnaud - in return for Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey. Other players involved in the deal were catchers Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas, both headed to Toronto, veteran catcher John Buck, who went to New York, and young P Wuilmer Becerra who also made his way to the Mets.\n Syndergaard went 9-4, 3.06 between the Class A St. Lucie Mets and the AA Binghamton Mets in 2013, striking out 133 in 117 2/3 innings, In 2014. he spent the season in AAA with the Las Vegas 51s, going 9-7, 4.60 in the favorable hitting environment. He maintained his prospect status those two years, as he was up to #11 according to Baseball America and #10 according to mlb.com before the 2015 season. He started that season back in Las Vegas, but after going 3-0, 1.82 in his first five starts, he was called up to New York to make his major league debut on May 12th, taking the place of an injured Dillon Gee. Facing the Chicago Cubs, he held them scoreless until the 6th inning, locked in a duel with Jake Arrieta, until he allowed three runs, including a two-run homer by Chris Coghlan, and was chased after 5 1/3 innings. He was charged with the 6-1 loss. He picked up his maiden victory in his next start, on May 17th, when he beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 5-1, throwing 6 innings. In that game, he beaned Carlos Gomez with a 95 mph fastball in the 6th inning, putting him out of the game. On May 27th, he hit his first career home run, taking Sean O'Sullivan of the Philadelphia Phillies deep, while also pitching 7 1/3 scoreless innings in a 7-0 win. It was the first home run by a Mets pitcher since 2012 and he also collected hits in his other two at-bats. On July 10th, he struck out 13 batters in 8 innings in a 4-2 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. On July 28th, he was perfect for 6 innings before allowing a lead-off single to Will Venable of the San Diego Padres to lead off the 7th, then pitched two more scoreless innings as the Mets won, 4-0; he struck out 9 and walked none in another dominant performance. He had a definite Jekyll and Hyde going between home and road starts, as he was 8-1, 1.82 at home and 0-5, 5.05 on the road before he earned his first road win on August 25th, 6-5 over the ­Phillies, although even that win increased his road ERA. He went 9-7, 3.24 in 24 starts, with 166 strikeouts in 150 innings. He then made four appearances in the postseason, including three starts, winning a game in both the NLCS and in the World Series, the latter being the Mets' only win of the series as they went down in five games against the Kansas City Royals.\n Already noted as one of the hardest-throwing starting pitchers in the game, on May 11, 2016, he staked a claim as the hardest-hitting pitcher by blasting two home runs off Kenta Maeda of the Los Angels Dodgers. As one of the shots came with two men on, he accounted for all four of his team's runs in a 4-3 win. The last major league pitcher to hit two homers in  a game had been Micah Owings, in 2007, while Walt Terrell had been the only Mets pitcher to ever accomplish the feat, on August 6, 1983. On May 28th, he was ejected in the 3rd inning of a start against the Dodgers when home plate umpire Adam Hamari ruled he had deliberately thrown at Chase Utley in apparent retaliation for Utley's dangerous slide which had injured Ruben Tejada in the previous year's Division Series. He was tabbed by the Mets to start the 2016 National League Wild Card Game at home against the San Francisco Giants and Madison Bumgarner. All observers predicted a tight pitchers' duel, and that exactly what they got, as Syndergaard matched Bumgarner for seven innings, giving up no runs on two hits and three walks while striking out 10. However, things went south after he left, as the Mets escaped a bases-loaded situation in the 8th, and then saw Conor Gillaspie hit a three-run homer off closer Jeurys Familia in the 9th to go down to a 3-0 defeat.\n Syndergaard was named the Mets' opening day starter in 2017 and got off to an excellent start, pitching 6 scoreless innings against the Atlanta Braves on April 3rd. However, the game was still scoreless when he left, and he had a no-decision even though the Mets eventually won, 6-0. He pitched very well over his first four starts, going 1-1, 1.73, with an amazing K/W ratio of 30/0 in 26 innings, but he also began to experience soreness in his forearm. On April 27th, he had to skip a start because of the condition, and there was serious worry that he would need to go on the disabled list. He claimed that there was nothing seriously wrong and refused the team's suggestion that he undergo an MRI, but when he next took the mound on April 30th, he had to leave the game against the Washington Nationals in the 2nd inning clutching his side in pain. This time there was no avoiding an MRI. He was placed on the disabled list the next day as the exam revealed a partial tear of the right lateral muscle. The prognosis was that he would not return until after the All-Star break. In fact, his return only came on September 23rd, and it was largely symbolic, as he pitched one inning in a start against the Nationals. He needed just five pitches to retire the side, thanks to former teammate Daniel Murphy grounding into a double play, but the point was that he was able to make it back before the end of the year. As planned, Matt Harvey, another pitcher making a comeback from an injury, then took over in the 2nd. He made one final appearance on October 1st, this one of two innings, to finish the season at 1-2, 2.97 in 7 starts.\n Back on the field in spring training in 2018, he created a buzz by hitting triple digits on the radar gun 11 times in two innings in his first start. That showed he was in full health, but in the usual soap opera surrounding the Mets, there was also some hair-pulling over whether he was overdoing things this early in the year. He was named the Mets' Opening Day starter, taking over for Jacob deGrom who had started spring training late because of an injury. He got off to a good start, going 4-1, 3-06 in his first 11 games, but on May 29th he went on the disabled list because of a strained ligament in his right index finger. However, contrary to the previous year, the DL stint was expected to be a short one this time. He was still out for a good six weeks, coming back just before the All-Star break on July 13th. He made a couple of starts, winning them both, then was placed back on the DL on July 22nd with a rare ailment: hand, foot and mouth disease. This usually affects children, and speculation was that he got infected while working in a children's camp over the break. He finished the season with a flourish, as he threw his first career shutout on the final day of the season, September 30th, defeating the Miami Marlins, 1-0. He finished the year at 13-4, 3.03 as he and deGrom formed a tremendous duo at the top of the starting rotation for what was otherwise a very ordinary team.\n Syndergaard started the 2019 season slowly as he was 1-3, 6.35 in 6 starts in March/April. On May 2nd, he pitched a gem, however, as he hurled a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds and also hit a homer off Tyler Mahle in the 3rd inning to account for the only run in a 1-0 win. The last pitcher to homer and throw a shutout in a 1-0 win had been Bob Welch, back in 1983. For good measure, Noah also fanned 10 batters in the game. There was more controversy typical of the Mets in September, as the media leaked information to the effect that Syndergaard had complained to the team's brass about pitching to catcher Wilson Ramos. He tried to cool down the story, but it was already a surprise he had not been sent packing at the trading deadline, and most observers expected this to be only a short reprieve until an off-season deal. He finished the year at 10-8, 4.28 in 32 games, with 202 strikeouts in 197 2/3 innings. He led the NL with 94 earned runs allowed.\n He was still with the Mets when spring training started - and was then stopped - in 2020. He began experiencing discomfort in his elbow before training camps shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Team trainers recommended an MRI exam, which showed that Tommy John surgery would be required, with the hope that he could be ready to return some time before mid-season in 2021. He did indeed return towards the end of that season. He made two starts, going 0-1, and pitching just 2 innings with an ERA of 9.00. He became a free agent after the season and the Mets made him a qualifying offer of $18.4 million, but he declined it and on November 16th signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels for $21 million. The Angels were placing a big bet - that he would return to his pre-injury form, and willing to put not only a large amount of money but also compensation in the form of a second-round pick in the 2022 amateur draft on his return to form. He made his first start for his new team on April 9th, wearing number 34 in tribute to former Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart, killed by an intoxicated driver that same day in 2009 just as his career was getting under way. He had a strong first outing, pitching 5 1/3 scoreless innings in a 2-0 win over the Houston Astros. He continued to pitch well after that, going 5-8, 3.83 in 15 starts. On August 2nd, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in return for OFs Mickey Moniak and Jadiel Sanchez. With the Phils, he was 5-2, 4.12 in 10 games to finish with a combined record of 10-10, 3.94 and 95 strikeouts in 134 2/3 innings, his strikeout rate well below that of his prime seasons reflecting the fact that he had lost a number of miles per hour on his fastball. In the postseason, he was on the bubble between starting an relieving, pitching one inning in relief in Game 2 of the Division Series against the Atlanta Braves before getting the start in Game 4 three days later on October 15th. He was not expected to go deep and indeed left after giving up one run in three innings, on a solo homer by Orlando Arcia as the Phils won the game, 8-3. In the NLCS against the San Diego Padres, he was passed over in favor of young Bailey Falter in Game 4 on October 22nd, a move Philadelphia came to regret as Falter did not get out of the 1st inning, giving up 4 runs, and he ended up pitching an inning and a third in relief in the wild game that finished 10-6 in the Phillies' favor. In the World Series against Houston, he was selected to start Game 3 on October 31st in place of Ranger Suarez, who had been used in relief in a key spot in Game 1. As had been the case in his Division Series start, he was not expected to go deep into the game. However, a rainout changed those plans, allowing the Phillies to start Suarez. He finally got the ball to start Game 5, on November 3rd. After giving up a run in the 1st, he was perfect in the 2nd and 3rd innings. His outing would normally have been over at this point, but Rob Thomson had him start the 4th inning, and it turned out to be a mistake as he gave up a homer to Jeremy Pena before giving way to Connor Brogdon. The two runs were enough to saddle him with a 3-2 loss.\n He became a free agent again after the season and on December 14th it was reported that he had come to terms with the Los Angeles Dodgers on a one-year contract worth $13 million. Things did not go very well for him as at the end of May, after 11 starts, his record stood at 1-4, 6.54 and there were calls for the team to simply release him given the Dodgers were in contention for the postseason and could not afford to effectively punt away every fifth start. He probably would have been dropped from the starting rotation already were it not for a rash of injuries to the team's starting rotation having sidelined Julio Urias, Dustin May and Ryan Pepiot, leaving few options available. He ended up making just one more start for L.A., on June 7th, when he gave up 6 runs in 3 innings before being placed on the injured list with a finger blister the next day. On July 15th, he began a rehabilitation assignment with the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers, but before he could return to the big team, he was traded to the Cleveland Guardians on July 26th in return for SS Amed Rosario. The Dodgers also threw in $1.9 million in cash to help pay for Noah's remaining salary. In his first start for Cleveland on July 31st, he was hit in the leg by a line drive off the bat of Jeremy Pena of the Houston Astros in the 6th inning. he was leading 2-0 at the time, but one of the runners he had put on base that inning came in to score after he left the game, and Cleveland eventually lost, 7-3. In all, he made 6 starts for Cleveland, going 1-2, 5.40, and was let go on August 27th, with manager Terry Francona citing his propensity to allow the gopher ball as the main reason for the move.\n Off the field, Syndergaard is known for his sense of humor, particularly in his twitter feed. In particular, he carried on a hilarious twitter feud with, of all possible nemeses, the Mets' mascot, Mr. Met."},

He began playing that year with the Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League where he hit .241/.279/.358 in 58 games. In 2014, he played for the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York-Penn League and the Savannah Sand Gnats of the South Atlantic League, hitting a combined .274/.320/.372 in 75 games. In 2015, the Mets promoted him to Advanced Class A, with the St. Lucie Mets, to begin the year and he handled the level well enough to also play a couple of games in AA with the Binghamton Mets. At St. Lucie, he hit .257/.307/.335 in 103 games.\n The 2016 season was the one in which Amed truly emerged as a top prospect. Starting the year back at St. Lucie, he hit .309 in 66 games, and then scorched the Eastern League with Binghamton, to the tune of a .341 BA in 54 games. He payed for the World Team in the 2016 Futures Game and finished the year with a combined line of .324/.374/.459 in 120 games. He began to show promising power with 24 doubles, 13 triples and 5 homers, scored 65 runs and drove in 71. His 5 homers matched his total for his first three pro seasons. In 2017, he was assigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s to start the year and was again named to play in the Futures Game with the World team. By then, fans in New York were clamoring for him to be called up to the Big Apple, as the Mets were badly in need of productive infielders, with an unhappy Asdrubal Cabrera and an aging Jose Reyes manning the two keystone positions. Journalists were speculating that the Mets were delaying the inevitable move in fear of further rocking a clubhouse that had seen a lot of dissension during a trying first half, with the risk that the veterans on the team would turn against the promising rookie, putting him in a difficult situation just as he was trying to get his feet wet. But he did make his debut that season, on August 1st and he played 46 games the rest of the way, hitting .248 with 4 homers and 10 RBIs.\n He was the starting shortstop for the Mets for the next three seasons, playing 154 and 157 games respectively in 2018 and 2019. He improved each year, hitting .256 with 9 homers and 51 RBIs the first year and .287 with 15 homers and 72 RBIs the second, his OPS also climbing steadily, from 76 in his partial rookie season, to 88 and 101. He wasn't All-Star material yet, but was progressing fine and heading into his age 24 season seemed to be in the process of establishing himself as the long-term shortstop of the Mets.\n On August 28, 2020, he did something that had never been seen in major league history. He hit a walk-off homer off Aroldis Chapman to give the Mets a 4-3 win over their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. What was unusual was that the homer came in the bottom of the 7th inning, the game being the second one of a doubleheader with MLB having decreed that doubleheaders would consist of two seven-inning games that season, due to COVID-19. It was also hit on the road, at New Yankee Stadium, because the second game was a make-up date for an earlier postponed game in which the Mets were supposed to be the home team. So no one before him had ever hit a walk-off homer, on the road, in the 7th inning - and it was likely that such a feat would not be repeated any time soon either. However, overall, the shortened season was a step-back for him, as his batting average fell to .252, his OPS+ to 76, and he hit just 3 doubles, 1 triple and 4 homers as the Mets were unable to take advantage of the expanded postseason field. Following the season, multi-billionaire Steven Cohen completed his purchase of the team and made it clear he was prepared to spend money to improve the on-field product. When the Cleveland Indians made it known that impending free agent SS Francisco Lindor would be available for the right price, the Mets made it known that they were interested, having the money to lock him down into a long-term deal. On January 7, 2021 a trade was made, with Lindor and P Carlos Carrasco heading to the Big Apple, with Rosario, fellow infielder Andres Gimenez, and youngsters P Josh Wolf and Isaiah Greene going to Cleveland.\n The question in spring training in 2021 was who would be Cleveland's starter at shortstop: Rosario or Gimenez, both of whom had tried to claim the job with the Mets. After a couple of weeks, the Indians seemed to be leaning to Gimenez, as they asked Rosario to practice in the outfield in order to secure more playing time. He started off the year slowly, as he was batting just .179 at the end of April. He went back to starting at shortstop in May and hit a lot better - .307 with a .443 slugging percentage in 24 games to secure his starting job. He had his best month in August, when he batted .372 and capped it off with a career day against the Kansas City Royals on August 31st, when he went 5 for 5 with a pair of homers - one of which was an inside-the-parker - and 5 RBIs in a 7-2 win. He finished the year at .282 in 141 games, with 11 homers and 57 RBIs and an OPS+ of 100. He had a very similar season in 2022 for the now re-named Cleveland Guardians, batting .283 in 153 games with 11 homers and 71 RBIs. He scored 86 runs, led the American League with 9 triples (and also with 134 singles) and put up an OPS+ of 106. The Guardians won the AL Central division title and he went 2 for 9 as they defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the Wild Card Series. In the tightly-fought Division Series against the New York Yankees, he was 5 for 20 with a home run and 2 RBIs.\n He started the 2023 season slowly, but was finding his stroke, raising his average to .265 in 94 games by the end of July, although his OPS+ was still just 89. More problematic was that his fielding numbers were poor across the board, as he ranked among the worst starting shortstops in the majors by most metrics. The Guardians had a couple of good prospects angling for playing time, and on July 26th traded Rosario to the Los Angeles Dodgers in return for veteran P Noah Syndergaard, who was about to come off the injured list after a rough first few months. The Dodgers had been desperate for infield help ever since Gavin Lux had suffered a season-ending injury in spring training."},

He did not sign and pitched for Canada in the 2013 World Junior Championship; his 3.12 ERA was exactly the same as the team total. He then went on to college at Stanford University and was selected in the first round of the 2016 amateur draft, 8th overall, by the San Diego Padres. At Stanford, he was the first freshman to be the opening day starter since Mike Mussina, but had to undergo Tommy John surgery as a sophomore. He came back the next year when he was drafted; he was also able to complete his engineering degree in just three years. He began his pro career with the AZL Padres. He also pitched for the Tri-City Dust Devils and Fort Wayne Wizards that first season.\n He was named to the World team for the 2017 Futures Game. That year he was 7-10, 3.80 in 22 starts between the Class A Lake Elsinore Storm and the AA San Antonio Missions. In 2018, he made 28 starts and pitched 148 innings, going 9-6, 4.80 between San Antonio and the AAA El Paso Chihuahuas. He then started off the 2019 season going 3-1, 5.40 in his first 5 starts for El Paso and on May 1st was called up to make his major league debut. Starting against the Atlanta Braves he gave up 2 runs in 5 2/3 innings and was charged with a 5-1 loss. He was the first player from the 1st round of the 2016 draft to make it to the Show, preceding #2 overall pick Nick Senzel by only a couple of days, although a number of players drafted in lower rounds had made it before them. He earned his first win in front of friends and family on May 25th, with a start against the Toronto Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre in which he gave up 3 runs in 6 innings as the Padres won handily, 19-4. Sporting an ERA of 5.23 after 6 starts, he was sent back to the minors for a brief spell, then was used out of the bullpen for the remainder of June. On July 14th, he was matched up against fellow Canadian Mike Soroka of the Braves in what was the first major league game started by two Canadian pitchers since 2013, when Ryan Dempster had faced Scott Diamond. Both pitchers did very well, with Quantrill tossing 6 scoreless innings and Soroka 7. The Braves eventually won the game, 4-1. He ended his rookie season with a record of 6-8, 5.16 in 23 games, including 18 starts, logging 103 innings and striking out 89 opponents.\n In 2020, he started the year working out of the bullpen for the Padres, making only 1 start in his first 10 appearances. He was 2-0, 2.60 during that stretch, as the Padres were in serious contention for the postseason. The top brass began to make deals in order to strengthen that position before the trading deadline of August 31st, and on that day, he was sent to the Cleveland Indians in a blockbuster trade. Joining him were C Austin Hedges and OF Josh Naylor as well as three prospects, Gabriel Arias, Joey Cantillo and Owen Miller - as the Padres acquired ace P Mike Clevinger, OF Greg Allen and a player to be named later. He went 0-0, 1.84 in 8 games for Cleveland after the trade, then faced two batters in the 9th inning of Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the New York Yankees on September 30th, walking Aaron judge before striking out Aaron Hicks. However, New York had just taken a 10-9 lead against Brad Hand before he entered the game, and Cleveland was unable to tie it against Aroldis Chapman in the bottom of the inning, ending its season.\n In 2021, he went 8-3, 2.89 in 40 games, including 22 starts, logging 149 2/3 innings in what was the final season which Cleveland played under the Indians name. Becoming the Cleveland Guardians in 2022 they won a division title in the AL Central and Cal was at the center of things, going 15-4, 3.38 in 32 starts. In 186 1/3, he struck out 128 batters, leading the team in wins and finishing behind Shane Bieber and Triston McKenzie in both innings pitched and strikeouts. In the postseason, he made two starts against the Yankees in the Division Series, but lost them both, allowing a total of 7 runs (6 earned) in 10 innings. Still the Guardians looked set in terms of starting pitching, with a trio of youngsters seemingly hitting their prime at the same time, and a number of others waiting in the wings. Things did not go well in 2023, however, and it started in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, when he started Team Canada's first game against Great Britain but failed to complete the 1st inning as he struggled with his control. Things went just as badly for Cleveland during the season as he was 4-7, 5.24 in 19 starts, allowing 111 hits in 99 2/3 innings. He pitched well in September, however, with a 2.76 ERA over his final 6 starts after battling injuries. Bieber and McKenzie also had down years, and the Guardians failed to make the postseason even if Tanner Bibee emerged as another potential ace. \n Cleveland did something completely unexpected on November 14, 2023, when it had Cal designated for assignment in order to open room on the 40-man roster for more young pitchers coming up in the organization and liable to be picked up by another team in the 2023 Rule V Draft. The decision made Quantrill a free agent."},

He was also named to the American Baseball Coaches Association/Rawlings All-Midwest Region Team, a National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Freshman All-American, a Louisville Slugger Third Team All-American, the Mid-American Conference Freshman Pitcher of the Year and a Collegiate Baseball Freshman All-American. In 2015, he was 5-5 with a 3.27 ERA in 16 starts to earn All-MAC Second Team honors. He also played for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod League that year. Scout.com said he \"has a chance to be a top-three round selection [in 2016].\" He was eventually taken in the 12th round of the 2016 amateur draft by the Cleveland Indians and made his professional debut with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers of the New York-Penn League in 2017.\n He reached the majors with the Indians at the end of May in 2019 and quickly secured a regular turn in the starting rotation, taking advantage of openings created by a rash of injuries. On September 10th, he pitched his first career complete game and shutout in defeating the Los Angeles Angels, 4-0, on a four-hitter. He was the first Indians rookie to pitch a shutout since Jeremy Sowers in 2006. He had a good rookie season, making 21 starts and pitching 115 2/3 innings, ending up at 8-6, 3.81. On August 9, 2020, he became the first player to be disciplined by his own team for breaking health and safety protocols put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He had been seen the night before leaving the team's hotel in Chicago, IL without authorization. The Indians sent him home immediately and placed him in isolation until tests could demonstrate that he had not been infected. Teammate Mike Clevinger was then found to have also gone out that fateful evening and was also suspended. Plesac tried to justify himself in a video minimizing what he had done, but it went over like the proverbial lead balloon, as it seemed to demonstrate that he was still completely impervious to how stupid his actions had been. By the time he took the mound again on September 1st, Clevinger had been traded and he had had some time to reflect on his conduct, apologizing to his teammates before reeling off 6 innings of a one-run ball in a 10-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. On September 18th, he threw an immaculate inning in the 2nd inning of a 1-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers. He finished the season at 4-2, 2.28 in 8 starts, with an outstanding K/W ratio of 57/6 in 55 1/3 innings. He did not pitch in the postseason, as the Indians were eliminated in two games by the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series, with Shane Bieber and Carlos Carrasco starting the two games.\n On May 13, 2021, he took the attention away from the joint major league debuts of first-rounders Jarred Kelenic and Logan Gilbert for the Seattle Mariners by nearly no-hitting them. He held Seattle hitless through the first seven innings before J.P. Crawford led off the 8th with a single, and Dylan Moore hit a two-run homer later in the frame. He left the game after that inning, then almost lost the win as well when closer Emmanuel Clase walked the bases loaded in the 9th before Bryan Shaw bailed him out, preserving Zach's 4-2 win. When the Indians were no-hit through a combined performance by Corbin Burnes and Josh Hader of the Milwaukee Brewers on September 11th, it marked a record third time that Zach was on the losing end of a no-hitter. He had also been the losing pitcher when Carlos Rodón of the Chicago White Sox tossed a no-hitter on April 14th, and when Wade Miley of the Cincinnati Reds did so on May 7th, as the Indians were the first team ever to be no-hit three times in a single season. He finished the year at10-6, 4.27 in 25 starts, with 100 strikeouts in 142 2/3 innings.\n In 2022, the Indians became the Cleveland Guardians and won a division title in their first season under their new guise. He made 24 starts in 25 appearances that year, going 3-12 in spite of a not awful 4.31 ERA while playing in front of a decent team. Obviously, this was the worst record among the Guardians' starters, and he was relegated to bullpen duty in the postseason, making his only appearance in Game 4 of the Division Series against the New York Yankees on October 16th, when he pitched a hitless inning in a 4-2 loss. Things then went even worse in 2023 as he was limited to 5 starts, going 1-1, 7.59, before being sent down to the minor leagues, where he did not pitch much better: in 19 games (18 starts) for the AAA Columbus Clippers, he was 5-6, 6.08, giving up 98 hits and 42 walks in 94 2/3 innings. \n He became a free agent after the season, and with the Guardians organization producing a number of young pitchers, he had to switch teams. The Los Angeles Angels took a flyer on him, signing him to a deal on December 30, 2023.\n Another uncle, Joe Plesac, spent time in the minor leagues."},

He made his first major league start on May 8th, against the Toronto Blue Jays; he was the first lefthander to start a game for the Guardians that season."},

Norris reacted like a seasoned pro, striking out Big Papi to end the inning.\n Norris got some publicity when he arrived in spring training in 2015­ when he explained that he lived in his van out on a Wal-Mart parking lot and cooked his meals on a portable stove. The van was not the typical athlete's SUV, but a vintage 1978 Volkswagen camper - albeit beautifully restored. He received a lot of ribbing from teammates for his unusual choice of ride, including R.A. Dickey who decided to have some fun and drive it onto the field in Dunedin, FL. Following a spring injury to Marcus Stroman, who was lost for the season, Norris made the Jays' starting rotation out of spring training and started and won the Jays' third game of the season, 6-3 over the New York Yankees for his first career victory. However he made only 5 starts, going 1-1, 3.86, before the Blue Jays sent him down to the minors at the end of April. He then struggled with the AAA Buffalo Bisons, going 3-10, 4.27 in 16 starts. On July 30th, Toronto sent Norris, Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt to the Detroit Tigers in return for David Price.\n Daniel was excellent in his debut with the Tigers on August 2, 2015, as he allowed only 1 run in 7 1/3 innings in a start against the Baltimore Orioles and was credited with a 6-1 win. On August 19th, he became the 19th pitcher in major league history to hit a home run in his first at-bat, connecting off Jon Lester in the 2nd inning of a game against the Chicago Cubs. Unfortunately for him, he suffered a strained oblique in the 5th inning and had to be placed on the disabled list. He came back in mid-September, and on September 22nd pitched 5 hitless innings in a start against the Chicago White Sox. The game was still scoreless when he left, and Buck Farmer, Ian Krol and Drew VerHagen each pitched a hitless inning in relief. The Tigers held a 1-0 lead entering the top of the 9th, but Neftali Feliz allowed a one-out triple to Tyler Saladino to end the no-hit bid; Saladino eventually scored, but the Tigers won the game in 10 innings, 2-1. He ended the season with a record of 3-2, 3,75 in 13 starts between the two teams. After the season, he announced that he had been diagnosed with a form of thyroid cancer a few months earlier, but then reported at the end of October that after an operation, he was now cancer-free.\n In 2016, he went 4-2, 3.38 in 14 games, then followed that with a 5-8 record and an ERA of 5.31 in 22 games in 2017. He also spent time in the minors both of these seasons, as various ailments kept him from reaching his full potential. 2018 was another season when he was bothered by injuries, as he appeared with four different minor league teams on rehabilitation assignments, and pitched just 11 games in the majors, going 0-5, 5.68. He was finally healthy in 2019, spending in the entire season in the majors, and pitching 32 times, including 29 starts. The results were so-so, as he went 3-13, 4.49 but reached personal highs in innings (144 1/3) and strikeouts (125). These numbers were reached in spite of the fact that the Tigers decided to limit his innings that season with an unusual strategy: starting on August 11th and for his final 9 starts, he pitched exactly three innings each time out, by design. He did well, putting up an ERA of 3.33, but went 0-4 as he was ineligible to win any of these games even when he pitched well.\n In June 2020, he was one of the MLB players to be infected by the COVID-19 virus. He started feeling awful after a surfing outing and tested positive a few days later, although there is no way to know how and where he contracted the disease. While the effects of the disease had abated when training camp re-started, he still had to stay away due to quarantine regulations, until he could test negative twice. He ended up pitching just 14 times, with only 1 start, but otherwise putting up good numbers, as he went 3-1, 3.25. He was not the typical short reliever, as he logged 27 2/3 innings over the 14 games, and managed 28 strikeouts. In fact, his one start, in his first appearance of the year against the Cincinnati Reds in the second game of a doubleheader on August 7th, accounted for his only loss with 2 runs allowed in 1 2/3 innings. Otherwise, he was excellent in his new-found role."},

He made his pro debut that summer with the GCL Marlins, hitting .327 in 25 games. He had hit .484/.556/.903 for Canada in the 2015 U-18 Baseball World Cup and was named the All-Star first baseman.\n He has a reputation as someone who likes playing practical jokes and pranks, but that proved costly in June of 2016 when he injured teammate and fellow prospect Stone Garrett in a prank that involved a knife. While full details were not released by the Marlins, the end result was that Garrett had to have stitches and suffered nerve damage in his thumb requiring surgery. Naylor was suspended for one game for his role in the affair. On the field, he was selected to play in the 2016 Futures Game as part of the World team, the on July 29th, he was traded to the San Diego Padres as part of a seven-played blockbuster deal that brought starting pitchers Andrew Cashner and Colin Rea to Miami.\n He was a member of the Canadian national team for the 2017 World Baseball Classic, although he saw little action with Freddie Freeman starting at first base and Justin Morneau playing DH. He returned to the Futures Game in 2017, again as a member of the World team. In 2018, the Padres switched him from first base to the outfield after signing Eric Hosmer to a long-term free agent contract, locking up the position for the foreseeable future. He played 128 games for the San Antonio Missions of the AA Texas League that year, hitting .297/.383/.447 with 17 homers and 74 RBIs.\n He got to make his debut in his hometown as he was called up to the majors on May 24, 2019 with the Padres on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays. He went 0 for 4 as the designated hitter in a 6-3 win. The next day, he started in right field and collected his first major league hit in the 1st inning, an RBI double off Edwin Jackson. He collected two more hits before the end of the day as the Padres won handily, 19-4. He split his time between left field and right field the rest of the way, hitting .249 in 94 games, with 8 homers, 29 runs and 32 RBIs. The Padres had a very crowded outfield, as he had to fight for playing time with Manuel Margot, Hunter Renfroe, Franmil Reyes and Wil Myers, all of whom got regular playing time, not to mention Alex Dickerson, Nick Martini and Travis Jankowski, who appeared in the majors, and prospects knocking at the door like Edward Olivares and Taylor Trammell. The Padres began dealing away some of the surplus, with Margot, Renfroe and Reyes all leaving in separate deals, but two other outfielders in Tommy Pham and Trent Grisham joined the ranks as part of the shuffle. So Josh was still fighting for playing time at the start of 2020, only appearing in 18 games over the first five weeks, and hitting .278 with 1 homer and 4 RBIs. The Padres were a much improved team and as the trading deadline loomed, began to make deals to address areas of weakness. Both Olivares and Trammell were used as trade chips, and on August 31st, Josh joined them when he was sent to the Cleveland Indians alongside C Austin Hedges, P Cal Quantrill and three top prospects - Gabriel Arias, Owen Miller and Joey Cantillo - to obtain ace P Mike Clevinger and OF Greg Allen. He hit .230 in 22 games for the Indians, to finish at .247 with 1 homer and 6 RBIs. Naylor made his debut for the Indians on the day of the trade, making an out as a pinch-hitter. He then was the Indians' best hitter in the postseason, when they were swept in two games by the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series, going 5 for 7 with 3 doubles and 1 homer.\n On April 14, 2021, he came within a whisker of breaking up Chicago White Sox pitcher Carlos Rodon's bid for a perfect game. As the lead-off batter in the 9th, he hit a ground ball to 1B Jose Abreu who beat him to the bag by the slightest margin, the two sliding almost simultaneously. The next batter, Roberto Pérez, was hit by a pitch to end the perfect game, but Rodon did pitch a no-hitter. On June 27th, he suffered a serious ankle injury in a collision in the outfield in the 4th inning of a game against the Minnesota Twins. He collided with 2B Ernie Clement and landed awkwardly after jumping to get out of the way. He had to be carted off the field with a fracture and did not play again that season. He was off to a solid start, batting .253 with 7 homers and 21 RBIs in 69 games, one of the better marks on a team struggling to find any offense.\n He returned to the now-Cleveland Guardians as their first baseman at the start of the 2022 season. On May 9th, he did something unprecedented when he collected 8 RBIs in a 12-9 win over the Chicago White Sox - all of them starting in the 8th inning! He hit a double in the 8th to drive in a first run, added a grand slam off closer Liam Hendriks in the 9th, and then a three-run blast off Ryan Burr in the 11th to provide Cleveland with its margin of victory. The grand slam, the first of his career, came with two outs and capped a six-run comeback in the top of the 9th that forced the playing of extra innings, and the two teams also exchanged single runs in the 10th. The Guardians' winning probability was 0.2% entering the top of the 9th with a six-run deficit. No player had ever hit two homers worth three runs or more each in the 9th inning or later, and only two others in Cleveland history had ever hit two homers of any kind in the 9th or later (Earl Averill and Willie Kirkland). He hit another dramatic home run on June 29th, this one in the bottom of the 10th against Jharel Cotton of the Minnesota Twins. The Twins had scored 3 runs in the top of the 10th to take a 6-3 lead, but Cleveland countered against Emilio Pagan and Cotton, bringing up Josh with two out and a runner on second, with the score now 6-5 for Minnesota. Twins C Ryan Jeffers first allowed a passed ball to move the runner, Amed Rosario, to third base, and Naylor then hit a long fly ball down the left field line that landed in the seats for a walk-off homer, giving the Guardians spectacular 7-6 win. He went on to celebrate effusively, even giving a head-butt to manager Terry Francona. Luckily, Francona was wearing a helmet, so he escaped without damage. Josh hit .256 in 122 games that season, with 20 homers and 79 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 121. He was in the middle of some controversy in the postseason when, after hitting a home run off Gerrit Cole of the New York Yankees in the 4th inning of Game 4 of the Division Series on October 16th, he made a rocking-the-baby motion while circling the bases. The Yankees fans, showing their well-known sense of restraint, declared him public enemy number 1 because of him and booed him relentlessly in Game 5, in a display of class that only they can display.\n He decided to skip the 2023 World Baseball Classic, even though his younger brother Bo Naylor, who had made his debut with the Guardians in the final days of the previous season, was the starting catcher for Team Canada, which could have used his bat in the line-up as it was forced to start a couple of inexperienced players in the outfield after losing 1B Freddie Freeman to a hamstring injury. He was once again one of the Guardians' best hitters in the first half of the 2023 season, batting .205 with an OPS+ of 124 after 65 games. On June 21st, when Bo, who had started the year in AAA, collected his first major league hit in a game against the Oakland Athletics, he was probably even more excited than his younger sibling. Bo had been 0 for 17 for his career at that point, and the hit came at a crucial point of the game, with Cleveland down 6-5 in the 8th, so it's understandable that Josh was elated. The hit started a two-run rally for a 7-6 win. On July 14th, in the Guardians' first game after the All-Star break, he and Bo both hit two-run homers in the 3rd inning of a game against the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park. They were the first pair of brothers to hit multi-run homers for the same team in the same inning, and only the 13th pair to both homer in the same game. Unfortunately, the Rangers then scored 12 unanswered runs to win the game, 12-4. He finished the season at .308 in 121 games, with 31 doubles and 17 homers for an OPS+ of 133. He fell just shy of the 100-RBI mark, ending the year at 97. He received some down-ballot consideration in the MVP vote, then was named the winner of the Tip O'Neill Award as the best ballplayer from Canada.\n His younger brother, Bo, was selected 29th overall in the 2018 amateur draft, by the Indians and reached the majors in 2022. A third brother, Myles Naylor, was taken by the Oakland Athletics in the Competitive Balance Round A in the 2023 amateur draft. His cousin is Denzel Clarke."},

A third brother, Myles Naylor, was taken by the Oakland Athletics in Competitive Balance Round A in the 2023 amateur draft. \n Like his older brother, Bo was a youth baseball star in the Toronto, ON area and played on the Canadian junior national team, including at the 2017 U-18 Baseball World Cup that was held in Thunder Bay, ON in September 2017. He had a very good tournament for the fourth-place hosts, being named to the tournament All-Star team as the third baseman. One notable play was scoring the tying run against Japan; when the throw beat him home, he pulled off a great slide to make it in safely. He hit .313/.463/.406 with 8 walks, 6 runs and 4 steals (never caught) in 9 games, fielding .968 at the hot corner as well. He tied for 5th in the Cup in doubles (3), tied for 4th in walks and tied for 5th in swipes. He was joined on the All-Star infield by Leonardo Seminati, César Prieto and Brice Turang.\n He was selected in the 1st round of the 2018 amateur draft by the Cleveland Indians, with the 29th overall pick. He was listed as a multi-position player at the time, but the Indians soon had him concentrate on catching. He played his first professional season in 2018 with the AZL Indians 2, hitting .274/.381/.402 in 33 games. In 2019, he moved up to the Lake County Captains of the Midwest League where he hit .243/.313/.421 in 107 games,  with 18 doubles, 10 triples and 11 homers. He scored 60 runs and drove in 65 while being a full 2.3 years younger than the average player in the league. In 2020, he spent the season at the Indians' alternate training site when the minor leagues were shut down by the Coronavirus pandemic. At the end of August, his brother Josh joined him in the Indians organization when he was acquired in a trade with the San Diego Padres for P Mike Clevinger. In 2021, he spent the season with the Akron RubberDucks of the Double-A Northeast, but he fell to .187/.280/.332 in 87 games. On the positive side, he did hit 13 doubles and 10 homers, scored 41 runs and drive in 44. He was also named to play for the American League squad at the 2021 Futures Game. He split the 2022 season between Akron and the AAA Columbus Clippers, batting .263/.392/.496 in 118 games, with 73 runs, 23 doubles, 21 homers and 68 RBIs. He made his big league debut with the now Cleveland Guardians on October 1st, going 0 for 2 as a defensive replacement in a 7-1 loss to the Kansas City Royals. His brother Josh was playing DH in that game, and when he made his first start the next day, he was batting just behind his older brother in the Guardians' batting order. Overall, he went 0 for 8 in 5 games for Cleveland and while he was eligible for the postseason did not appear in any games.\n In 2023, he was the starting catcher for Canada at the World Baseball Classic, starting all four games. His brother elected not to suit up for the Canadians, although the team could have used his bat in the line-up. The highlight of the tournament was hitting a home run off José Urquidy of Mexico in Canada's final game on March 15th. Bo started the season in the minors with Columbus and hit .254 in 60 games, with 13 homers and 48 RBIs to earn a call-up to Cleveland on June 18th (he had previously been called up as the 27th man in a May 21st doubleheader against the New York Mets, going 0 for 2). He collected his first major league hit on June 21st, in a 7-6 win over the Oakland Athletics. He had been 0-for-17 for his career until that hit, which sparked the winning two-run rally in the bottom of the 8th. On July 14th, he and his brother both hit two-run homers in the 3rd inning of a game against the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park; they were the first pair of brothers to ever hit multi-run homers for the same team in the same inning, and only the 13th pair to homer in the same game. Unfortunately, the Rangers then scored 12 unanswered runs to win the game, 12-4."},

He moved to the Class-A Bowling Green Hot Rods in 2009, where he was 8-5, 3.15 in 26 starts. He struck out 176 batters and emerged as a top prospect, being named #35 on Baseball America's top 100 prospect list after the season.\n Pitching for the Charlotte Stone Crabs of the Florida State League in 2010, Moore's 6-11 record in 26 starts was superficially unimpressive, but he had a very good 3.36 ERA and struck out an outstanding 208 batters in 144 2/3 innings, a Rays organization record at the time. He was named the circuit's Pitcher of the Week on four different occasions and made the league's All-Star team at the end of the year. His prospect ranking prior to the 2011 season had improved to #15. He started the season with Montgomery Biscuits of the AA Southern League, where he was outstanding over the first half.

He continued just where he had left off, making 9 starts with a 4-0 record and a 1.37 ERA while again striking out well over a batter per inning. He was named the Southern League Pitcher of the Year and got the call to Tampa Bay in September, by which time he had climbed to #3 on Baseball America's prospect list. Overall he ranked second overall in the minor leagues in ERA (1.92), strikeouts (210) and opponents' batting average (.182) and was tops in strikeouts/9 innings at 12.2. He was a mid-season All-Star in the Southern League, and a post-season All-Star in the International League. He made his major league debut in relief on September 14th, and won his only start of the year with 5 scoreless innings in a key game against the New York Yankees on September 22nd, finishing the year 1-0, 2.89 in 3 appearances. With the Rays' starters dead tired after beating the Boston Red Sox for the American League­ wild card, Moore was the surprise choice to start Game 1 of the ALDS against the Texas Rangers on September 30th. Belying his age and lack of experience, Moore pitched a superb game, holding the Rangers scoreless for 7 innings as the Rays won handily, 9-0. His other appearance, in Game 4, was also quite good, although he gave up a solo home run to Adrian Beltre in 3 innings of relief - the only hit he gave up. The Rays lost the game, 4-3, and the series that day. After the season, the Rays wasted no time in placing their young pitcher in the fold for the long-term, signing him to an 8-year deal that could be worth almost $40 million if he remains in the big leagues for the entire time span.\n As a rookie in 2012, Moore made 31 starts for the Rays, pitching 177 1/3 innings with a record of 11-11, a 3.81 ERA and 175 strikeouts. The Rays were careful not to allow him to pitch too many innings. he was 10th in the American League in strikeouts, but his 81 walks also placed him 7th. He also finished in the top 10 in the league in strikeouts per nine innings and fewest hits per nine innings, both statistics being excellent indicators of future success.\n Moore had a tremendous month of April for the Rays in 2013, going 5-0 with a 2.33 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 32 innings; however, he lost out to the Boston Red Sox's Clay Buchholz for Pitcher of the Month honors in the American League. On May 14th, when he earned a 5-3 win against the Boston Red Sox­, he became the first pitcher in the AL to reach 7 wins, and the first in Rays history to start a season 7-0. That sparkling record went along with a 2.44 ERA and an opponents' batting average of only .172 at that point. When he defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 3-1, on May 19th, to go 8-0, he set the Rays franchise record with 9 consecutive wins, beating a mark set by teammate David Price the previous season, and also evoked the great Babe Ruth: at 23 years old, he was the youngest lefty to start a season 8-0 since the Babe had done so at age 22 in 1917. He suffered his first loss of the season on June 4th, when the Detroit Tigers whacked him for 6 runs on 7 hits and 6 walks in 2 innings on their way to a 10-1 win. He set a personal record for wins on July 6th when he defeated the Chicago White Sox, 3-0, to improve to 12-3. He was not originally selected to play in the 2013 All-Star Game, but was added to the American League squad when Yu Darvish went on the disabled list with an injury. After pitching a scoreless inning in the All-Star Game, he recorded his first career complete game and shutout on July 22nd when he blanked the Boston Red Sox, 3-0, on 2 hits. Unfortunately for the Rays, he had to be placed on the disabled list on July 31st because of a sore muscle in his left elbow, although the injury was not thought to be major. He missed all of August, then went 3-1 in 6 September outings, although those were kept short, as he only once pitched into the 7th inning. He ended the season at 17-4, 3.29 in 27 starts and 150 1/3 innings. He started Game 1 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, suffering a 12-2 loss, then pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Jeremy Hellickson in Game 4 but was not involved in the decision.\n Moore then made two starts in 2014 before running into more serious injury issues. He was tagged with a 3-0 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on April 2nd, then left his April 7th start against the Kansas City Royals in the 5th inning when he felt something wrong in his elbow. He was placed on the disabled list and sent to see Dr. James Andrews for a diagnostic, who recommended Tommy John surgery, thus ending Matt's season. He was out of the big leagues until July 2, 2015, when he made his return as a starting pitcher for the Rays. He made 12 appearances for the team, all as a starter, missing all of August except of an August 1st start. He went 3-4, 5.43 in 63 innings as he was still working his way back to full strength.\n Moore was one of the heroes of Tampa Bay's historic game in Havana, Cuba on March 22, 2016 against the Cuban national team, as he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Rays, getting credit for the 4-1 win. In the regular season, he made  21 starts for Tampa Bay, with a record of 7-7, 4.08. He pitched 130 innings, showing he was back in full health and on August 1st, he was acquired by the San Francisco Giants in a trade for three players: IF Matt Duffy and minor leaguers Lucius Fox and Michael Santos. However, if the Giants were looking for immediate help from Matt, it didn't quite work that way, as he lost two of his first three starts with his new team, the other one resulting in a no-decision, and while he pitched exactly 6 innings each time out, it was with a 4.50 ERA. On August 25th, he started a key game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Giants in danger of falling four games back in the division race. He responded with the best start of his career, holding the Dodgers hitless through eight innings and coming within one out of throwing a no-hitter. Rookie Corey Seager broke his bid with two outs in the 9th with a single to right, and Moore left the game immediately, having made over 130 pitches. Still, his tremendous effort resulted in a 4-0 win and San Francisco moving back to within two games of L.A. He went 6-5, 4.08 for the Giants to finished with a combined line of 13-12, 4.08 and 178 strikeouts in 198 1/3 innings. He made one postseason start, in Game 4 of the NLDS on October 11th, and was very good, allowing just 2 runs in 8 innings, but he was not involved in the decision as the Giants lost the game, 6-5, to the Chicago Cubs.\n Moore's lone full season with San Francisco, in 2017, was a tough one, however. The team sank to the bottom of the National League standings and he contributed to the fall by going 6-15, 5.52 in 32 games. Both his 15 losses and 107 earned runs allowed led the league. He pitched 174 1/3 innings and struck out 148 batters. After the season, the Giants decided to dispose of some higher-paid player as they needed to rebuild after their wreck of a season, and Moore was a victim, being traded to the Texas Rangers on December 15th in return for two minor leaguers, Israel Cruz and Sam Wolff. 2018 was just as bad, as he went 3-8, 6.79 for Texas. He was taken out of the starting rotation after 12 starts, and ended up with a majority of his 39 appearances coming in relief - largely in long relief as he 102 innings. The source of his problems was pretty obvious: even though his strikeout rate was still good, he just allowed too many batters to reach base, with 128 hits and 41 walks. Following the season, he signed as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers. He made the opening day roster after a strong spring in 2019 and had an excellent first start against the Toronto Blue Jays on March 31st, allowing just 2 hits and a walk in 7 innings, but he ended up with a no-decision. He then had to leave his next start, against the Kansas City Royals on April 6th after just 3 innings, having hurt his knee while attempting to field a bunt. He was immediately placed on the injured list and on April 17th, the Tigers announced he was done for the year as he would need to undergo knee surgery. He thus finished the year with a virgin ERA in 10 innings, being sidelined just as he had seemed to be recapturing his past form.\n He then signed with the Softbank Hawks for 2020. He was 6-3 with a 2.65 ERA. Had he qualified, he would have been third in the Pacific League in ERA (behind Kodai Senga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto), though he was nearly last among Softbank's regular pitchers (Shuta Ishikawa and Nao Higashihama were both better, while Tsuyoshi Wada was also under 3). He got the start in Game 3 of the 2020 Japan Series and threw seven hitless innings (2 BB, 5 K) against the Yomiuri Giants; Liván Moinelo and Yuito Mori nearly completed the second Japan Series no-hitter, but the Giants got a hit with two outs in the 9th. The Hawks still cruised to a historic second straight Japan Series sweep. Ryoya Kurihara was named Series MVP. Following that successful season In Japan, he decided to return to Major League Baseball and on January 29, 2021 he signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies for $3 million."},

He did not pitch much that year as he sprained his ulnar collateral nerve in his right elbow. Timed at 100 mph in high school, he was still intriguing enough despite the injury to be picked by the Washington Nationals 16th overall in the 2012 draft. Surprisingly, he was not even the first pitcher taken from his school, as Max Fried went at #7. He signed just before the deadline for a $2.925 million bonus and made his pro debut with the GCL Nationals on August 14th, allowing one run in two innings but reinjured his elbow before he could appear again and underwent Tommy John surgery.

He struck out 110 in 98 innings, walking only 28. He played in the 2014 Futures Game, but was shut down in mid-August, as the Nationals wanted to limit his innings coming off the surgery, as they had infamously done with ace Stephen Strasburg two seasons earlier. Mlb.com ranked him as the top righthanded pitching prospect in baseball coming into the 2015 season. He split that year between the Potomac Nationals of the Carolina League and the Harrisburg Senators of the AA Eastern League. He was a combined 7-7, 3.15 in 21 games, with 131 strikeouts in 117 innings. He returned to the Futures Game that season.\n The Nationals announced on June 27, 2016 that Giolito would make his major league debut the next day starting against the New York Mets. They had just placed Strasburg on the disabled list and needed another starter. He had begun the year at Harrisburg, where he was 5-3, 3.17 in 14 starts at the time of his call-up. His debut came on a rainy night that cut his outing to only four innings, but he impressed during that time, allowing no runs on only one hit and a pair of walks. Washington won the game, 5-0, but he had to settle for a no-decision. He made only 6 appearances for the Nats, including 4 starts ending up 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA. In addition to his time at Harrisburg, he made 7 starts for the AAA Syracuse Chiefs, going 1-2, 2.17 for a combined minor league line of 6-5, 2.97. On December 8th, he was one of three young pitchers  traded by Washington to the Chicago White Sox in return for CF Adam Eaton, the others being Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning.\n Giolito only made 7 starts for the White Sox in 2017, going 3-3, 2.38 as he continued his apprenticeship in the minors. He was with the AAA Charlotte Knights for most of that season, going 6-10, 4.48 in 24 starts. On May 25th, he pitched a seven-inning no-hitter against the Syracuse Chiefs in the first game of a doubleheader. In 2018, he spent a first full season in the majors with the White Sox, but he found the going rough, even though he won in double figures. He finished with an ERA of 6.13 and 90 walks allowed in 173 1/3 innings. He led the American League in both walks and earned runs allowed (118). His record was 10-13, and on the positive side, he gave up less than a hit per inning (166 in 173 1/3) and struck out 125. He got off on the right foot in 2019 as in his first start of the year on March 31st, he took a no-hitter into the 7th inning before Alex Gordon of the Kansas City Royals singled with one out. He gave up a couple more hits and 2 runners came in to score before he was taken out, but he still ended up with credit for a 6-3 win. It was a sign of things to come as he took a big step forward. He was the American League Pitcher of the Month in May when he went 5-0, 1.74 in 6 starts. As a reward for his remarkable transformation into a top-notch starter, he was named to the All-Star team. He finished the season at 14-9, 3.41, leading the American League in complete games (3) and shutouts (2). He also struck out 228 batters in 176 2/3 innings and was 6th in the voting for the Cy Young Award.\n In 2020, the White Sox finally emerged as a contender for the title in the AL Central, and Lucas was at the center of things as the team's ace. On August 25th, he pitched the first no-hitter in the major leagues that season, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-0, at Guaranteed Rate Field. The game was played without fans present, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He struck out 13 and walked just one batter, Erik Gonzalez, the only baserunner of the evening. SS Tim Anderson helped him with a great stop of a ground ball by Bryan Reynolds, just beating him to first base in the 7th, while RF Adam Engel made a great catch on a line drive by Gonzalez to record the final out of the game. It was the 19th no-hitter in franchise history, and the first since Philip Humber's perfect game in 2012. He went 4-3, 3.48 in 12 starts that season, then won his only start of the postseason, defeating the Oakland Athletics, 4-1, in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series on September 29th. He only gave up 2 hits and 1 walk in 7 innings while striking out 8.\n In 2021, he had another good season, going 11-9, 3.53 in 31 starts for Chicago, while striking out 201 batters in 178 2/3 innings. He returned to the postseason, this time facing the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the Division Series on October 8th. He gave up 4 runs in 4 1/3 innings and was not involved in the decision as Houston won the game, 9-4. The White Sox fell back in the standings in 2022 but he again finished at 11-9, albeit with a much higher ERA than in 2021, at 4.90 in 30 starts. His strikeouts also fell, to 177 in  161 2/3 innings. He pitched well over the first four months of the 2023 season, going 6-6, 3.79 in 21 starts. The White Sox were again out of contention, however, and on July 26th they traded him and fellow veteran pitcher Reynaldo Lopez to the Los Angeles Angels in return for two prospects, P Ky Bush and C Edgar Quero. Things did not go well on the West Coast, however, as the Angels went into a tailspin after making these trading deadline moves, with Lucas going 1-5, 6.85 in 6 starts. As August ended, he was one of six veteran players placed on waivers by the Angels in order to cut costs as they were throwing in the towel, and five of them were picked up by other teams. In Giolito's case, he joined the Cleveland Guardians, but his first start against the Minnesota Twins on September 4th was a disaster, as he gave up 9 runs in 3 innings in a 20-6 lopsided loss. In fact, things were so bad that utility player David Fry had to pitch four innings to finish the game! In a statistical side note, Giolito was the first pitcher to give up at least eight runs in a game for three different teams in the same season since Bill Magee in 1899. He finished the year with a combined record of 8-15, 4.88 in 33 games, all starts, and 184 1/3 innings. The 41 homers he allowed were the most in the American League. He became a free agent after the season.\n On December 29, 2023, it was announced that he had signed a two-year deal with the Boston Red Sox for $38.5 million.\n Source: MLB.com"},

His first professional experience came in 2016, with the DSL Mets 1 and DSL Mets 2, where he hit a combined .350 in 62 games. Given his outstanding hitting in the Dominican Summer League, he skipped a couple of minor league levels when he moved to the United States, being sent straight to full-season Class A with the Columbia Fireflies of the South Atlantic League in 2017. While teammate Tim Tebow was gathering all the media attention, he hit an impressive .265/.346/.349 in 92 games as the team's regular shortstop, while 3 1/2 years younger than the average player in the league.\n Gimenez continued his rapid progression in 2018, splitting the season between the St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League and the Binghamton Mets of the Eastern League. In 122 games, he hit .281/.347/.409, with 62 runs scored. He was named to play in the 2018 Futures Game and was an organizational All-Star. He did struggle in the Arizona Fall League after the season, hitting just .125, but not having turned 20 yet, he was much younger that the average player in that circuit composed of the best prospects in all of baseball. He spent 2019 in AA with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, where he hit.250/.309/.387 in 117 games.\n Giménez had not posted eye-popping numbers in the minors, but when the Coronavirus pandemic resulted in the minor league season being canceled in 2020, the Mets decided to bring him up with the big league squad, even if they would likely have chosen to at least start the year at AAA had that option been in the cards. He ended  playing pretty well, as he hit .263 in 49 games, with 22 runs scores, 3 homers and 12 RBIs. His OPS+ of 102 was actually quite a bit better than that of starting shortstop Amed Rosario, considered a future cornerstone of the team. Without a regular position, Gimenez played 23 games at SS, 19 at 2B and 10 at 3B, as manager Luis Rojas tried to have him in the line-up as much as possible. His solid production did not go unnoticed, and on January 7, 2021, when the Cleveland Indians traded SS Francisco Lindor and P Carlos Carrasco to the Mets, he was one of the four young players they received in return, alongside Rosario, P Josh Wolf and OF Isaiah Greene.\n He struggled in his first season with the Indians in 2021 as he was hitting just .180 after 29 games as the starting shortstop and was sent down to AAA on May 17th. He found his strike back with the Columbus Clippers, hitting .287 in 52 games with 13 doubles and 10 homers, and returned to Cleveland on August 8th. He hit .246 in 39 games the rest of the way to finish at .218 with 5 homers and 16 RBIs for an OPS+ of 74. However, he ahd a break-out season in 2022 with the re-named Cleveland Guardians. He was moved from shortstop to second base at the end of May, but was batting over .300 at that point, the move being made to slot Rosario at shortstop (he had been a super-utility player until then). He was named to the All-Star team as a second baseman and got to start the game due to an injury to José Altuve. He finished the year at .297 in 146 games, with 17 homers, 66 runs and 69 RBIs, for an OPS+ of 141. He also led the American League in hit-by-pitches with 25 and won the Gold Glove at second base. In the postseason, he went a combined 5 for 28 (.179) as the Guardians made it to Game 5 of the Division Series before being eliminated by the New York Yankees.\n Giménez did not have as strong a season with the bat in 2023 as he had the year before as he slipped to .251 in 153 games, with 15 homers, 76 runs and 62 RBIs. This looked similar to the previous year's numbers, but his OPS+ tumbled all the way down to 98, as he used many more outs to achieve the same results. However, it was another strong year with the glove as he repeated as winner of a Gold Glove at second base, and was also named the winner of the Platinum Glove as the best overall defender in the the American League."},

In 2019, he hit .258 in 134 games for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League, with 41 doubles, 17 homers and 70 RBIs. In 2021, when he resumed playing, he was at both AA and AAA, hitting a combined .255/.348/.449 in 94 games, with 19 doubles and 12 homers. Just before the start of the 2022 season, he was sent to Cleveland as the player to be named later to complete an earlier trade for J.C. Mejia, then spent the season in AAA with the Columbus Clippers. He was mainly a third baseman and first baseman in his 119 games, with 12 games a s a catcher, and hit .256/.329/.450 with 17 homers and 71 RBIs. He was back with Columbus at the start of 2023 and was hitting .317 after 29 games before getting the call to Cleveland.\n In his rookie season, he was used all over the field, starting games at five different positions: the two corner outfield spots, the two corner infield spots, and catcher, although overall he had few at-bats, with just 84 in his first 43 games. He was also used as a mystery pitcher in a lopsided loss to the Chicago Cubs on June 30th, pitching a scoreless inning, and on September 4th, he made one of the longest such outings in recent history when he pitched four full innings in a 20-6 loss to the Minnesota Twins, allowing 7 runs on 10 hits, three of them homers. The last position player to pitch that long in a game had been Jose Oquendo in 1988, but under completely different circumstances, as in his case, his team had run out of pitchers in an extra-inning game, and he had been asked to take the mound in the 16th - and managed to keep his team in the game for a number of frames before things imploded. In Fry's case, starter Lucas Giolito had allowed 9 runs in just 3 innings, and reliever Enyel De Los Santos had given up another 4, putting the game completely out of reach by the 6th inning, at which point Fry took over and just lobbed the ball over until the game ended, using 64 pitches."},

In 2017, he returned to Winston-Salem.  While he was only hitting .214 after 75 games, he played in the 2017 Futures Game, sharing catching duties with Chance Sisco.

He played 9 games, but went just 1 for 16. He also had one at-bat in the postseason, striking out, as part of Chicago's loss to the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Series.\n In 2021, with McCann having left, he was now Grandal's back-up, with rookie sensation Yermin Mercedes acting as the DH and emergency third catcher.

He had a great major league debut for the Indians against the Detroit Tigers on June 22, 2019. He struck out the side in the 1st inning, and went on to pitch 6 scoreless innings, allowing just 2 infield hits, to receive credit for a 2-0 win. Civale made 10 starts, encompassing 57 2/3 innings, with a great 2.34 ERA. Evidently, these solid numbers were not solid enough to keep a roster spot during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indians sending him to Triple A the day before a universal roster freeze."}
